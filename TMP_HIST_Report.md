- the US acknowledged the independence of the Philippines. However...
	- the US to continue military operations in the PH
	- This statement conflicted with the idea of complete independence for the Philippines.

**1943**
- the beginning of negotiations for the presence of American military bases in the Philippines
	- during the time of exile in Washington of the Philippine Commonwealth
- kept in secret until in **1947**
	- the public disclosure of an agreement concerning US bases was made

**Agreement Concerning Military Bases, Manila, 14 March 1947** or **1947 Military Bases Agreement**
- under the leadership of Pres. Roxas, argued that maintaining US military bases in the country was necessary for:
	- peace, mutual defense, and military cooperation.
	- mutual defense - as a newly independent nation, faced various challenges and potential threats in the post-World War II era. Allowing the US to maintain military bases was seen as a means to strengthen the country's defense capabilities and deter potential aggressors.
	- peace
	- economic considerations - The agreement also involved granting [[parity]] rights to Americans. This meant that American citizens in the Philippines would have equal economic and legal rights as Filipino citizens. Pres. Roxas and his government saw this as an opportunity to attract US investments and promote economic development in the country. They believed that by maintaining favorable economic ties with the US, the Philippines could benefit from increased trade and economic growth.
- as a result, the agreement was signed, allowing the US to continue using military bases in the Philippines.

Overall, Pres. Roxas and his administration weighed the benefits of security, stability, and economic development against concerns about complete independence and made the decision to allow the US to maintain military bases in the Philippines.

**Message of President Roxas to the Senate on the Agreement Concerning American Military Bases in the Philippines**
- emphasizes that the base agreement with the United States is not inconsistent with Philippine independence. The bases were seen as a guarantee of security and national integrity, provided by American forces in a manner that the Philippines could not achieve on its own.
- The Philippine negotiators insisted that no military bases be maintained in centers of large population, particularly in Manila, to avoid potential friction and misunderstanding. This was initially in conflict with the United States Army's plans, but after representations and discussions, a compromise was reached.

### Report Outline
- Short introduction of how the 1947 Military Bases Agreement came to be
	- The **1934 Tydings-McDuffie Act** was signed by Pres. Roosevelt, provided a framework for granting the Philippines independence after a ten-year transitional period.
	- The **July 4, 1946 Treaty of Manila** signed by the United States and the newly independent Republic of the Philippines, marked the formal end of the colonial relationship between the two countries.
		- However, before the 1946 treaty, when the Commonwealth government was in exile in Washington, a secret agreement was signed between Philippine President Osmeña and US President Truman. Osmena "supported U.S. rights to bases in his country by backing them publicly and by signing a secret agreement.
		- Which then culminated in years that came to be the 1947 Military Bases Agreement signed by Osmeña's successor, Pres.Roxas
