**Treaty of Manila of 1946**
- the US acknowledged the independence of the Philippines. However...
	- the US to continue military operations in the PH
	- This statement conflicted with the idea of complete independence for the Philippines.

**1943**
- the beginning of negotiations for the presence of American military bases in the Philippines
	- during the time of exile in Washington of the Philippine Commonwealth
- kept in secret until in **1947**
	- the public disclosure of an agreement concerning US bases was made

**Agreement Concerning Military Bases, Manila, 14 March 1947** or **1947 Military Bases Agreement**
- under the leadership of Pres. Roxas, argued that maintaining US military bases in the country was necessary for:
	- peace, mutual defense, and military cooperation.
	- mutual defense - as a newly independent nation, faced various challenges and potential threats in the post-World War II era. Allowing the US to maintain military bases was seen as a means to strengthen the country's defense capabilities and deter potential aggressors.
	- peace
	- economic considerations - The agreement also involved granting [[parity]] rights to Americans. This meant that American citizens in the Philippines would have equal economic and legal rights as Filipino citizens. Pres. Roxas and his government saw this as an opportunity to attract US investments and promote economic development in the country. They believed that by maintaining favorable economic ties with the US, the Philippines could benefit from increased trade and economic growth.
- as a result, the agreement was signed, allowing the US to continue using military bases in the Philippines.

Overall, Pres. Roxas and his administration weighed the benefits of security, stability, and economic development against concerns about complete independence and made the decision to allow the US to maintain military bases in the Philippines.

**Message of President Roxas to the Senate on the Agreement Concerning American Military Bases in the Philippines**
- emphasizes that the base agreement with the United States is not inconsistent with Philippine independence. The bases were seen as a guarantee of security and national integrity, provided by American forces in a manner that the Philippines could not achieve on its own.
- The Philippine negotiators insisted that no military bases be maintained in centers of large population, particularly in Manila, to avoid potential friction and misunderstanding. This was initially in conflict with the United States Army's plans, but after representations and discussions, a compromise was reached.

### Report Outline
- Short introduction of how the 1947 Military Bases Agreement came to be
	- The **1934 Tydings-McDuffie Act** was signed by Pres. Roosevelt, provided a framework for granting the Philippines independence after a ten-year transitional period.
	- The **July 4, 1946 Treaty of Manila** signed by the United States and the newly independent Republic of the Philippines, marked the formal end of the colonial relationship between the two countries.
		- However, before the 1946 treaty, when the Commonwealth government was in exile in Washington, a secret agreement was signed between Philippine President Osmeña and US President Truman. Osmena "supported U.S. rights to bases in his country by backing them publicly and by signing a secret agreement.
		- Which then culminated in years that came to be the 1947 Military Bases Agreement signed by Osmeña's successor, Pres.Roxas

- **Article XIII** - Jurisdiction
	- Offenses committed outside the bases by members of the U.S. armed forces, where the offended party is also a member of the U.S. armed forces. And offenses committed outside the bases by members of the U.S. armed forces against the security of the United States.
		- Then its the US responsibility to exercise jurisdiction and proceed to investigate the case
	- However, if both the offender and the victim are Filipinos, then the US does not have jurisdiction over the offense. In such cases, the Philippine legal system would handle the investigation.
		- **EXAMPLE:** Marie, a US soldier, and Philippe, a Filipino soldier nag away sa canteen, which is in a US base. Suddenly, Marie suddenly stabs Philippe sa kasing2... now where does the jurisdiction lie to?
			- since there was a Filipino citizen involved despite being in a US base, its still up to the Philippines to exercise jurisdiction of both parties
		- **EXAMPLE1:** Another case, ang US and Philippines nag joint operate ug base on a remote island. Marie nasd, bulyagon kayo, nangawat ug CLASSIFIED (meaning IMPORTANT) document...
			- now, despite its on a joint military base between the US and the Philippines, moreover si Marie being a US citizen na dapat si US mo handle unta.
				- BUT, its against the security of the Philippines/a threat to the nation that Marie has committed so the Philippines will handle Marie's crimes.
	- The United States agrees not to grant asylum within any of the bases to any person fleeing from the lawful jurisdiction of the Philippines. If such a person is found in any base, they will be surrendered to the competent authorities of the Philippines upon demand.
		- This ensures that the individuals cannot seek protection or escape from legal consequences of their actions WITHIN the US military base.
		- Regardless of whether pinoy or foreigner, isurrender gihapon sila sa appropriate authorities of the Philippines
-  Now if the said crimes were committed, how and what is the process... now this is where Article 14 comes in
- **Article XIV** - Arrest & Service of Process
	- If a Philippine citizen commits an offense within a military base, the Philippine authorities would need to seek permission from the commanding officer of the base to make an arrest and serve a legal process. If permission is granted, they can proceed accordingly. However, if the commanding officer refuses permission, he shall take action to arrest the person and bring them to the appropriate Philippine authorities or serve the necessary legal process through other means. 
	- If the offense involves a member of the U.S. armed forces and falls under U.S. jurisdiction under Article13, the Philippine authorities would cooperate and provide assistance to the US in serving the necessary process and facilitating the arrest and surrender the alleged offender to the US.
	- Just to let you know:
		- Example of Offenses in bases (Military court) or Example anyone
			- Criminal cases in military are processed differently from us. There are Military courts and Civilian courts. Mostly because military has many laws that are specific to them, such as, sedition, mutiny, and failure to obey a lawful order and etc. Now they aren't civilian crimes so the military needs legal authority to handle these charges.
- **Article XIX** - Commercial Concerns
	- In simpler terms, this article grants the United States specific rights to businesses owned by either American or Filipino citizen for the use of military bases and facilities in the country.
		- **EXAMPLE:** A tech company from the US has advanced technology and wants it to be used in a US base in PH. Thanks to this article, the tech company was given the right to use a section of the base. And in return, the base benefits from the cutting-edge surveillance technology and security.
- **Article XXVII** - Voluntary Enlistment of Philippine Citizens
	- Give handouts
	- This enables the US to recruit Filipinos who want to enlist and train under the hood
		- BUT, the number of recruiters to be accepted are limited and will depend upon agreement of the two governments(US and Philippines).
- **Article XXIX** - Term of Agreement
	- Finally, the very last article. This is important because Article 29 - Term of Agreement
		- states that ONCE both government will accept the agreement, it will then be in effect for 99 years.
		- subject for extension of time period will be later on agreed by the two governments
- (**OPTIONAL** )Moreover, the US proposed to establish large-scale military base in Manila a very populated place, but Philippines declined as such to avoid misunderstandings to the Filipino citizens, when the Treaty of Manila was recently signed.
- Until the year 1991, negotiations for a renewal of the bases agreement failed, this marked the end of US military presence in the Philippines.
	- fully closing the two largest US base to operate on the Philippines
		- Subic Naval Base
		- Clark Air Base
- But on the year 2012, because of China's aggression towards the West Philippine Sea, the Philippines provided the US access up to five military bases.
- Now as we are about to end, this is why its important to know who we vote and what they stand for:
	- Just like Duterte, former president, making friends with China and as he announced a "separation from the US"
		- For this this will cost us a good relationship with the US, who is a superpower nation.
	- Or Pres, Marcos that recently agreed to the US to have access to four more bases in the Philippines
		- This picture depicts that because of us intervening with the US, makes us a possible target for China, (simbako) if war were to happen
- give reward who can guess the biggest army base of the Philippines. Fort Magsaysay
