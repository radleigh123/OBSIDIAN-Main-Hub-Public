**Elias**
$\qquad$An outlaw and vagabond revolutionary who resents the power the Catholic church and Spanish government have over the Philippines. After Ibarra saves his life from a vicious crocodile, Elías swears to protect the young man from his enemies, which are legion. Lurking in the town in the disguise of a day laborer, Elías discovers plots against Ibarra and does everything he can to thwart them. He also tries to convince Ibarra to join him and a band of disenchanted revolutionaries who want to retaliate against the abusive Civil Guard that empowers the church and oppresses the people it claims to govern.

$\qquad$He and Ibarra engage in long political discussions throughout the novel, each character outlining a different viewpoint regarding the nature of national growth and reform. Elías urges his friend to see that nothing productive will come of working within the existing power structures, since the church and government are both so corrupt and apathetic when it comes to actually improving the Philippines. Ibarra is more conservative and doesn’t agree with Elías’s drastic opinions until he himself experiences persecution at the hands of the country’s most powerful institutions, at which point he agrees with his friend and accepts his fate as a committed subversive revolutionary.
