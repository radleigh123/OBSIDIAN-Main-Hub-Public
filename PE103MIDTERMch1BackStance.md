## Back Stance
![[PE103MIDTERMch1BackStanceimage.png|center cover ws-med]]

-  Starting with the ready stance, move one foot backward 45 degrees away from the body
- The heels of the foot should form an imaginary “L” shape while the legs are in a straddle position
- The body should not be too low or extended otherwise it will be hard to maneuver
- Distribute the weight or center of gravity to both legs
- Back stances can be right foot lead, which is the Right Foot Back Stance or it can be left foot lead which is Left Foot Back Stance
- Back stances are used for blocking and backward evasion techniques.
