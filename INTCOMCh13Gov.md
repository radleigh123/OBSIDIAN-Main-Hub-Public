# Government
- Most government offices have websites to provide citizens with up-to-date information. People access government websites to apply for permits and licenses, apply for financial aid, renew vehicle registrations and driverâ€™s licenses and others.
- Law enforcement officials use computers and mobile devices to access emergency, missing person, and criminal records in computer networks in local, state, and federal agencies.
