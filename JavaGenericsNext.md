## What To Read Next
This book is a concise tutorial that doesn’t have room to cover Java generics in greater detail. If you’d like to get a deeper understanding of this topic, refer to the book ***Java Generics and Collections***, 2006, written by Maurice Naftalin and Philip Wadler and published by O’Reilly, ISBN 0-596-52775-6.

Bruce Eckel devoted almost a hundred pages to generics in the fourth edition of his book ***Thinking in Java***, 2006, published by Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-131-87248-6.
