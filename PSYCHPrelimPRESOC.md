## Pre-Socratics
The Pre-Socratics philosophers were Thales, Pythagoras, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Empedocles. They were concerned with answering questions such as:
- What is the world really made up of?
- Why is the world the way it is?
- What explains the changes that happen around us?
### The Pre-Socratics
- Arché- origin or source/the “soul”/the primal matter.
- The soul’s movement is the ultimate arché of all other movements.
- Arché has no origin outside itself and cannot be destroyed.
- Explains the multiplicity of things in the world.
