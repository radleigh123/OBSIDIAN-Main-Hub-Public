> The battle for the liberation of Manila from the Japanese rule was waged from February 3, 1945 to March 3, 1945 considered to be one of the greatest tragedies of World War II and was a turning point in the development of Philippine society More than 100,000 men, women and children died over the course of the Battle of Manila Homes, buildings and architectural works were also reduced to rubble. The photo of the destroyed Walled City of Intramuros shows the extent of the damage sustained by the City of Manila as Philippine and American troops fought against the Imperial Japanese forces.

# Independence and the Establishment of a New Republic
As one of the main provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, a transition government called the **Commonwealth** was established in the Philippines. Its main goal was to get the Filipinos ready for complete independence from the US and for self-rule. The Filipinos' desire for independence, first echoed in 1892 through the revolutionary society called the Katipunan, was finally within reach. This process toward self-governance, however, was rudely interrupted in 1941 by the empire of Japan which had been notoriously expanding in different East Asian territories since the 1930s. Under the guise of economic cooperation and shared prosperity, the Japanese eventually entered Philippine skies and shores on December 1941 after their surprise assault against the US Armed Forces in Pearl Harbor. Hostilities between the Japanese against the Filipinos and their American allies then ensued in various points of the archipelago. **Pres. Manuel L. Quezon**, together with other high-ranking officials of his US-sponsored government, were forced to move out of the Philippines. and to establish a government-in-exile, first in Australia and then in Washington. Meanwhile, after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor to the forces of General Masaharu Homma, General Douglas MacArthur had left the Philippines for Australia in March 1942 via Mindanao. It was also in Austria that MacArthur, the military advisor to the Commonwealth government, was quoted saying, "I came through and I shall return."

MacArthur's pledge, which sparked some hope among Filipinos amidst Japanese violence for the next three years, was finally fulfilled on October 20, 1944 when his forces landed in Leyte, liberating the Philippines from the Japanese. The following weeks and months witnessed American and Filipino victories all over the archipelago. Provinces in the Visayas, then in Luzon, were secured one by one. After a destructive and bloody campaign against the Japanese, Manila was liberated on March 3, 1945, then the entire Philippines on July 5, 1945. Outside the Philippines, Japanese forces were also on the retreat. Japan announced its surrender, through Emperor Hirohito himself, in a radio broadcast in August of the same year before being formally recognized by other belligerent parties on September 2, 1945. This surrender took place in the US Warship Missouri while docked at Tokyo Bay. The war in the Pacific was finally over.'

Back in the Philippines, the long-standing quest for independence also resumed. The Malacañan Palace was turned over to the Commonwealth government with Sergio Osmeña as the president. The Congress was once again able to convene and called for a general election on April 23, 1946. This particular race was won by Manuel Roxas, the third and final head of the Commonwealth and first for the Third Philippine Republic. Independence was finally proclaimed on July 4, 1946.

However, this feat came at a very unlikely, if not unfavorable time. The country was profoundly destroyed, both in the physical and the emotional sense. Buildings, houses, and other public works had been reduced to rubble while thousands of lives were prematurely ended by the war and its atrocities. Families were broken and a collective trauma among the populace was rather apparent. The enthusiasm for self-rule was replaced by anxiety caused by an uncertain future for the country. With a nation extensively damaged, where would rebuilding begin? How would the deep wounds inflicted by the war heal? Should the alleged war crime perpetrators and collaborators be punished or forgiven?

Such questions were probably the ones Filipinos had to confront during the early years of the postwar period. In this chapter, with the use of primary sources, the following will be discussed: the declaration of independence, the process of rehabilitation of the Philippines, and some of its other then-pressing concerns such as the damaged economy, the issue of US military bases in the islands, and the controversial collaboration issue with the Japanese. Some of the sources included are the Treaty of Manila of 1946, photos of postwar Philippines, the Bell Trade Act, the Military Bases Agreement of 1947, and the text of the amnesty provided by President Roxas to Filipinos charged with treasonable collaboration with the Japanese.

>[!NOTE]
> The signing of the Treaty of General Relations and Protocol or the Treaty of Manila of 1946 meant that the long-standing quest of the Filipinos to be free finally materialized. This historic event took place in Manila and was attended by several high-ranking Philippine and US officials. The raising of the Philippine flag and the lowering of the US flag were done in the ceremony.

### Treaty of General Relations and Protocol of 1946 or Treaty of Manila
The eventual Filipino independence promised by the Americans was formally realized in Manila on July 4, 1946, a date now regarded as the Republic Day or Filipino-American Friendship Day. This day marked the ratification of the document known as the Treaty of General Relations and Protocol or the Treaty of Manila of 1946. It was signed by Pres. Manuel Roxas and by the US High Commissioner, Paul V. McNutt the personal representative of US President Harry Truman to the Philippines.

This agreement officially 1) recognized the Philippines as an independent nation; 2) relinquished US sovereignty over the entire Philippine islands; and 3) gave the US to a) diplomatically represent the Philippines in other countries while a Foreign Service Office was pending to be established; and (b) to maintain its military bases in the archipelago. The full text of the treaty follows.

>[!NOTE]
> After the bombing of the Japanese August 1945, Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced to his people the formal surrender of the empire and their acceptance of the provisions written in the Potsdam Declaration. This was done through a radio broadcast now known as the Jewel Voice Broadcast aired on August 15, 1945, Hirohito read to his constituents the so-called Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War which contained Japan's formal surrender.

Photos of Manila After the War
The narratives about the ten-year transition period of the Philippines, as promised by the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, were unfortunately blemished by the atrocities of the war in the Pacific. As a next logical target of the Japanese Empire's expansionism which worked along the lines of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Philippines was ultimately dragged into the said worldwide conflict when Japanese forces invaded the Philippines hours after the destruction of Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
The next few years were some of the darkest in the archipelago's history-thousands of lives were lost; the economy was in bad shape; there was widespread famine; and the land was extensively damaged. It has been purported that Manila, next to the Polish capital of Warsaw, sustained the greatest physical destruction among the major theaters of the Second World War. The damage caused by the war to Manila, especially toward the end of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, had been well-documented in different photographs. Some of these are found below.

**Excerpt from the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 or Bell Trade Act**
Anticipating the eventual granting of independence to the Filipinos, a member of the US House of Representatives, Charles Jasper Bell of Missouri, filed a bill in September 1945 which aimed to govern the future trading relations between the US and the Philippines. This bill was later passed as a law and has since been known as the Philippine Trade Act or the Bell Trade Act of 1946. Some of the main provisions of the bill include
1) the fixed 2:1 exchange rug between the Philippine peso and the US dollar; 
2) the unlimited free trade between the Philippines and the US for the next eight years;
3) the gradual placing of tariffs on trade products until fall rates are achieved in 1974
4) and the granting of parity rights to the Americans. 
The fourth provision meant that American entities can tap resources which was reserved to the Filipinos as stated in the 1935 Philippine Constitution. Simply put, the Bell Trade Act compelled the Congress to amend the Constitution.
	The bill was received negatively by some critics for it was thought to tie the Philippines to the US economically even after the granting of independence. However, the US passed the bill as a complement to the Philippine Rehabilitation Act, which pledged a total of $620,000,000 ($120 million for the construction of public works, $400 million for individual damages, and $100 million in war surplus goods) as war reparations. However, the Rehabilitation Act provided that payments larger than $500 shall not be released unless the Philippines ratifies the Bell Trade Act first. This meant that the Philippines had to consent to both of the legislations in order to avail of the much needed war reparations. Through the Commonwealth Act 733 enacted on July 3, 1946, the Bell Trade Act was ratified by the Philippine Congress. An excerpts of the Act is found below.
