![[PE103MIDTERMch1StraddleStanceimage.png|center cover ws-med]]

- Starting with the ready stance, move one foot about two feet (2â€™) to the left or the right direction until both lower legs are almost perpendicular to the ground
- Both toes are pointing in front, the waist and the body is facing forward
- The body should not be too low or extended otherwise it will be hard to maneuver
- Distribute the weight or center of gravity to both legs. Straddle stance are also called Horseback Riding Stance since it mimics position when riding on a horse back
- Straddle stances are commonly used for blocking the strikes to the side of the body.
