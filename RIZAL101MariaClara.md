**Maria Clara**
A woman well-regarded in San Diego for her high social station. Having grown up together as childhood friends, María Clara and [[RIZAL101Ibarra|Ibarra]] are engaged to be married, though [[RIZAL101FatherDamaso|Father Dámaso]]—her godfather—is displeased with this arrangement and does what he can to interfere. When Ibarra is excommunicated after almost killing Dámaso at a dinner party, arrangements are made for María Clara to marry a young Spanish man named Linares. She doesn’t speak up against this idea because she doesn’t want to cross her father, [[RIZAL101CaptainTiago|Captain Tiago]], a spineless socialite who disavows Ibarra to stay in the good graces of friars like Father Dámaso.

Later, María Clara discovers that Captain Tiago isn’t her real father—rather, Father Dámaso impregnated her mother, who died during childbirth. When Ibarra is put on trial after being framed as a subversive by [[RIZAL101FatherSalvi|Father Salví]], María Clara is blackmailed into providing the court with letters Ibarra has sent her—letters his prosecutors unfairly use as evidence of malfeasance. She does so in order to keep secret the fact that Dámaso is her biological father, since she doesn’t want to disgrace her mother’s name or compromise Captain Tiago’s social standing. Still, she feels intense remorse at having sold Ibarra out. When the newspapers eventually falsely report his death, she calls off her marriage with Linares, instead deciding to enter a convent because she can’t stand to exist in a world that doesn’t contain Ibarra.
