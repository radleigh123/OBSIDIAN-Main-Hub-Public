### Political Government of the Philippines
This system revolves around three separate and sovereign yet interdependent branches: the **legislative branch** (<mark class="hltr-blue">the law-making body</mark>), the **executive branch** (<mark class="hltr-lightred">the law-enforcing body</mark>), and the **judicial branch** (<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">the law-interpreting body</mark>).

**Legislative branch**: The legislative branch is responsible for making laws. It consists of a group of elected representatives, such as members of parliament or congress, who debate and vote on proposed laws.

**Executive branch**: The executive branch is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws. It is headed by an elected official, such as a president, prime minister, or monarch, who is responsible for leading the country and overseeing the day-to-day operations of government.

**Judicial branch**: The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting and enforcing laws. It consists of a system of courts and judges who are responsible for settling legal disputes, upholding the constitution, and ensuring that laws are applied fairly and justly
