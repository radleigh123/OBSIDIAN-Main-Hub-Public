```java
// creative way of using ternary operator
int num = 1;

String result = num > 1 ? "Valid" : (num == 1 ? "Equals" : "Invalid");
```

**Data Structures & Algorithms - Midterms Project**
Implement a **Snakes game** in Java using arrays. The playing field is 100x100.
**Apple** generation should be random.
Snake grows when eating an apple.
Snake dies when it eats part of itself or hits the corners of the field
Do this w/ your lab partner aka "*Bestfriend*"
Will start checking by **October** first week.
