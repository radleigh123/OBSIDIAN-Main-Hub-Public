# Browsers and how they work?
**Web browsers** are the most widely used software. Its main function is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. 
> The resource is usually an [[HTML]] document, but may also be a PDF, image, or some other type of content.

The location of the resource is specified by the user using a [[URI]] (Uniform Resource Identifier). The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the [[HTML]] and [[CSS]] specifications. These specifications are maintained by the **W3C** (World Wide Web Consortium) organization, which is the standards organization for the web.

Browser user interfaces have a lot in common with each other. Among the common user interface elements are:
1. Address bar for inserting a URI
2. Back and forward buttons
3. Bookmarking options
4. Refresh and stop buttons for refreshing or stopping the loading of current documents
5. Home button that takes you to your home page
