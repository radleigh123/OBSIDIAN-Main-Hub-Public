## Side Stance
![[PE103MIDTERMch1SideStanceimage.png|center cover ws-med]]

- Starting with the ready stance, move one foot about two feet (2’) to the left or right direction
- Moving foot will be perpendicular to the ground while the other leg is extended thereby creating a position like that of a side kick
- Both toes are pointing in front, the waist and the body is facing forward.  The body should not be too low or extended otherwise it will be hard to maneuver
- Distribute the weight or center of gravity to both legs.  If the left foot moves to the side it becomes Left Foot Side Stance, if the right foot moves to the side it becomes Right Foot Side Stance
- Side Stances are commonly used for strike deflection and evasion techniques.
