![[PE103MIDTERMch1ObliqueStanceimage.png|center cover ws-med]]

- Starting with the ready stance, move one foot forward 45 degrees away from the body until the knee and the toe are in line to each other
- Move on the same direction as the lead foot (e.g.Â  for right foot lead, move 45 degrees forward to the right)
- Both toes are pointing in front, the waist and the body is facing forward
- The body should not be too low or the lead foot too extended otherwise it will be hard to maneuver
- Distribute the weight or center of gravity to both legs
- Oblique stances can be right foot lead, which is the Right Foot Oblique Stance or it can be left foot lead which is Left Foot Oblique Stance
- Oblique Stances are commonly used for forward blocking and evasion techniques.
