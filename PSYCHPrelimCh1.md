# Philosophy
- Study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially in an academic discipline. 
- A particular theory that someone has about how to live or how to deal with a particular situation.
- Academic discipline concerned with investigating the nature of significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs - investigates the legitimacy of concepts by rational argument concerning their implications, relationships as well as reality, knowledge, moral judgment, etc.
- As used originally by the ancient Greeks, the term "philosophy" meant the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, and comprised ALL areas of speculative thought, including the arts, sciences and religion.
- Philosophical questions (unlike those of the sciences) are usually foundational and abstract in nature. Philosophy is done primarily through reflection and does not tend to rely on experiment, although the methods used to study it may be analogous to those used in the study of the natural sciences.
## Much of Philosophy Concerns with the Fundamental Nature of Self:
- The Greeks were the ones who seriously questioned myths and moved away from them to understand reality and respond to perennial questions of curiosity, including the question of the self.
- The following are discussions of different perspectives and under- standings of the self-according to its prime movers. From philosophers of the ancient times to the contemporary period.
