# MOD1: Problem Solving Methods
> This six-step problem-solving method provides focused instructions to get the solutions you need.

### Define the problem
> Ask yourself: *What am I trying to solve*

- In addition to recognizing the problem, you should also <mark class="hltr-blue">establish the goal of what you want to achieve</mark>. Having a clear explanation of what you want to change means you’re on the right path.
### Determine the root cause(s) of the problem
- Recognizing the deeper issue helps to adjust the treatment and eliminate the root of the problem.
- <mark class="hltr-red">Don’t skip to the solution of the problem</mark> without recognizing its symptoms, it only means the problem will come back in the future.
### Develop potential solutions
- This is a <mark class="hltr-blue">brainstorming session</mark>, so don’t rule out some ideas because they don't seem perfect.
- Writing down your ideas is an important step, especially if you’re dealing with a complicated issue. It allows you to see everything better and makes it easier to choose the right solution and take action.
### Select a solution
> *Which solution seems the most feasible?*

- Think about the consequences for each of them. Start by excluding those that are unrealistic to do or not helpful in any way.
### Implement the solution
- It’s time to put everything from the paper into action. However, keep in mind that <mark class="hltr-blue">execution follows only after planning</mark>. If a problem applies to other people as well, establish these key things:
	- Who is responsible for implementation?
	- Who else is involved in the process?
	- What is the time frame for implementation?
	- What are the objectives?
	- What exact actions need to be taken before and during implementation?
- If you see that the solution you chose is failing to give you the outcome you desire, try using some of the different solutions you established before.
### Evaluate the outcome
> Devote some time to review the results

> What happened after you implement the changes?

- Analyze if your actions made the required impact and if you addressed the root causes of the issue.
