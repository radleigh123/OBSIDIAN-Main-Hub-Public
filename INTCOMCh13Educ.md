### **<mark class="hltr-green">Tech Feature</mark>** Digital School
Technology and education intersect in todayâ€™s classrooms. Students can use a variety of devices, apps, and websites to collaborate and obtain content, while teachers can share information in most content areas to engage students and enhance the learning process. Digital technology offers flexibility and a revised classroom setting.
-   **Mobile devices and tablets**: 
	- Schools are updating their computer labs by eliminating rows of desktops and allowing students to bring their own devices into the room and also into their classrooms, a practice often referred to as BYOD (bring your own device).
-   **Virtual field trips**: 
	- Virtual tours of museums, ancient sites, and galleries allow audiences to see exhibits, examine paintings, and explore historical objects. After viewing 360-degree panoramas of such places as Colonial Williamsburg and Machu Picchu, students can interact with experts via online social networks and videoconferencing.
-   **Games and simulations**: 
	- Game design theory can help engage students and reinforce key concepts. When students master one set of objectives in a particular topic, they can progress to more advanced levels. They can receive instant feedback and recognition for their accomplishments, collaborate with teammates, repeat play to achieve higher scores, and document their experiences. Researchers claim that students are more likely to pursue challenging subject matter when it is offered in a gaming setting.
-   **Interactive whiteboards**: 
	- Teachers and students can write directly on an interactive display, shown in the figure, which is a touch-sensitive device resembling a dry-erase board. It displays images on a connected computer screen. Touch gestures are used to zoom, erase, and annotate displayed content.
-   **Share projects**: 
	- Effective movies can bring the words in a textbook to life. Students can create scripts and then use animation software or a video camera to tell stories that apply the concepts they have learned and upload them to media sharing websites. They also can write blogs, design graphics, and conduct interviews to apply and share the concepts they have learned in the classroom.
-   **3-D printers**: 
	- Low-cost 3-D printers created for the classroom and libraries are becoming popular, especially in science and engineering classes. Geology students can create topography models, biology students can examine cross sections of organs, architecture students can print prototypes of their designs, and history students can create artifacts.
