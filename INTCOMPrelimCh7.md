# Data and Information
> A user inputs **data** into a computer, and then the computer processes it. Almost any kind of fact or set of facts can become computer data

## Data
- ==is a collection of unprocessed items==, which can include text, numbers, images, audio, and video. When data is processed into a meaningful form, it becomes **information**.


## Information
- ==conveys meaning to users==
- is frequently generated to answer some type of question
- Information Processing
	- **_the conversion of data into information_**
	- is a vital activity today for all computer users, as well as for businesses and other organizations.

### Data vs Information
> A computer processes data into information. In this simplified example, the item ordered, item price, quantity ordered, and amount received all represent data (input). The computer processes the data to produce the cash register receipt (information, or output).
