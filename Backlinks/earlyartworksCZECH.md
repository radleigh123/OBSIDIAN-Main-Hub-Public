> Art Nouveau legend Alphonse Mucha was born in Moravia but spent his early career in Paris creating celebrated art posters. In 1910 he returned to what is now the Czech Republic for the express purpose of painting 20 monumental canvases celebrating the history and folklore of the Slavic people. His monumental work was finished in 1928 and presented by the artist to the city of Prague.
