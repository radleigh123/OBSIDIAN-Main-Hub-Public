>> [!WARNING] **Never use the kickstands underneath most keyboards.**

### Ergonomic considerations
- Make sure that your keyboard is at the correct height, just above the level of your lap.
- Keep your wrists in the neutral (straight) position.![[Pasted image 20221012153655.png]]
- Adjust the height of your chair to make sure that your elbows are at a 90-degree angle, or more.
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and your elbows at your side.
- Keep a light touch on your keys when typing, as the tendons in your fingers are connected near your elbow. <mark class="hltr-lightred">Hitting the keys too hard may cause inflammation of the elbows.</mark>
- Align your body to the keyboard, depending on whether you use the letters or the numbers the most.
- Use keyboard shortcuts or macros for common, repetitive tasks to prevent overusing your hands and wrists.
- Buy an ergonomic keyboard if you already suffer from hand, wrist, arm or shoulder pains.
