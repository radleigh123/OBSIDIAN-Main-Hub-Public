>[!FAQ] # Unit 2.2 Input devices
>An **input device** is a piece of hardware that enables a user to enter data into a computer, or interact with a computer. These devices allow you to interact directly with your computer and devices where the data is saved or transmitted to your computer.

## Wireless vs Cabled devices
Computers have gone from machines that take up whole rooms, to something the average person can afford and keep on their desk, or even in their pocket.
>[!INFO]-
>Wired input devices are connected via a wire to the computer, allowing information to travel between the two devices.

## Risks associated with Input devices
-   **Keystroke logging**: This is a method used by hackers to record your keystrokes on the computer. The keystrokes can be used to identify personal information, such as bank details and passwords. Keystroke logging, also known as keylogging, is normally done with malicious software (**malware**) that is installed on your computer.
-   **Physical injury**: The extensive use of a keyboard, mouse, trackpad or touchpad might lead to physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or repetitive strain injury.
-   **Pathogen transmission**: If the input devices attached to a computer are used by a large number of people, it might play a role in the transmission of germs and other pathogens.
-   **Privacy issues**: If a webcam and microphone are connected to your computer, a hacker might be able to gain access to them. This will then allow the hacker to gain access to your private images and conversations. As with **keyloggers**, this is usually done by malware that is installed on your computer.

## Integration of input modes to enhance productivity and efficiency
The integration of input devices is a good way to enhance productivity and efficiency. Smartphones use integrated input modes to make users’ lives as easy as possible. These methods of input include the following:
-   **Touch screen**: The touch screen can be used to play games, type messages and interact with programs.
-   **Microphone**: The microphone can be used to talk to people, record messages and for voice recognition.
-   **Camera**: The camera can be used to take pictures and videos, and to scan things like QR codes, as well as facial recognition.

>[!INFO]-
>It is not only the integration of input devices that enhances productivity and efficiency, but also the integration of, for example:
>-   **Input/output devices:** A four-in-one printer, which you can use to print, copy, fax and scan using just the one hardware device, is a good example of increasing productivity and efficiency with the integration of devices.
>-   **Custom integrated software and input devices:** Integrating an input device, such as a barcode reader and OCR scanner with an administration system (software), will save time, accuracy and provide comprehensive data during stocktaking or auditing and surveying.
