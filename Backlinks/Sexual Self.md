During the early stages of human development, the embryonic reproductive structures of male and females are alike and said to be in the indifferent stage. When reproductive structures are formed, development of the accessory structures and external genitalia begins.

>[!NOTE]- Puberty
>- is the period of life, generally between the ages 10 and 15 years old. 
>- when reproductive organs grow to their adult size and become functional under the influence of rising levels of gonadal hormones.

>[!NOTE]- Erogenous Zones
>- Refer to parts of the body that are primarily receptive and increase sexual arousal when touched in sexual manner.

>[!NOTE]- Human Sexual Behavior
>- defined as any activity-solitary, between two persons, or in a group-that induces sexual arousal.
>
> | <center>**Solitary Behavior**</center> | <center>**Sociosexual Behavior**</center> |
> | ------ | ------ |
> | elf-gratification, means self-stimulation that leads to sexual arousal and generally, sexual climax. | Heterosexual behavior is the greatest amount of sociosexual behavior that occurs between only one male and one female. |

> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | Caused by increase in pulse and blood pressure; a sudden rise in blood supply to the surface of the body resulting to general increase in muscle tension | Generally brief duration. If stimulation is continued, orgasm usually occurs. | Feeling of abrupt, intense, pleasure, a rapid increase in pulse rate and blood pressure, and spasms in pelvic muscles causing contractions and ejaculation by the male. | The last stage that refers to the return to a normal or subnormal physiologic state. |

>[!ERROR]- Sexual Problems
> Sexual problems may be classified as **physiological**, **psychological** and **social** in origins.
> 
> | <center>**Premature Emission of Semen**</center> | <center>**Ejaculatory Impotence**</center> | <center>**Vaginismus**</center> |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | Most common in young men. Natural result of excessive tension in male who has been sexually deprived. | Results from the inability to ejaculate in coitus and is uncommon and is usually of psychogenic origin. | Strong spasm of the pelvic musculature constricting the female reproductive organ so penetration is painful or impossible. |
