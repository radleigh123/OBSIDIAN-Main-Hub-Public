> This delicate gesso wall panel, designed by Scottish Art Nouveau phenomenon Charles Rennie Mackintosh, depicts the ancient tradition of wassailing—originally a pagan fertility ritual. The frieze originally graced the Ladies’ Luncheon Room in Glasgow’s Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tearooms, and was part of a larger remodel of the premises by Mackintosh and his future wife, Margaret Macdonald.
