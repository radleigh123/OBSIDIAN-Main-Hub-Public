### Ergonomic Considerations
-   Computer mice come in different sizes and shapes; therefore, make sure that the mouse fits comfortably in your hand and is easy to use. Rather use a symmetrical shaped mouse than a curved one.
-   Do not grip the mouse hard. Hold it loosely.
-   Make sure that you are holding your mouse correctly â€“ i.e. rest your hand over the mouse and place your index finger on the left button of the mouse. You can rest your thumb and pinkie on the sides of the mouse.
-   Keep your mouse at the correct height and distance from your body, close to the keyboard.
-   Make sure that your elbow is bent and close to your body.
-   Use your whole forearm, not only your hand, to move the mouse. If you move only your hand, it will put strain on your wrist.
-   Keep your wrist straight. This will prevent your wrist from bending in an unnatural position.
-   Do not use a wrist rest, as that doubles the pressure inside the carpal tunnel.
-   Do not click too hard; rather use a soft touch to manipulate the mouse.
-   Adjust the speed at which your mouse moves, the time required between double-clicks, and the size of the cursor if you have problems controlling the mouse.
