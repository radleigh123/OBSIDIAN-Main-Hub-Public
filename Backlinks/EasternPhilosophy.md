# Eastern Philosophy
- The self as an essence does not exist according to Eastern philosophy, and this is because we are unaware of the fundamental nature of reality. The existence of the self and what it actually stands for are still up for the debate. These challenges and linguistic ambiguities hinder neuroscience research, which looks for the physical basis of the self in relation to specific brain structures and networks.
- People in the East are commonly inflexible in their beliefs and ideologies. They do not easily compromise nor question the long practiced customs and traditions. In Eastern countries, elders are considered as the leaders of the home and children often refer their choices to them and obey what they say.
- **Eastern Philosophy** teaches us to embrace the state of being a beginner. It is in this open-minded and curious state that we can absorb that many lessons available to us in our daily lives. In Eastern philosophy, the self is often treated as an illusion. That is, the idea that people are separate entities from each other and the world is not considered a reality in Easter thought.
