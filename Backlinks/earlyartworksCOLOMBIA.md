> Contemporary artist Fernando Botero is famous for his corpulent subjects, including the colorful cast of characters depicted in “Dancing in Colombia.” In addition to scenes of everyday life, Botero is also well known for his zaftig renderings of the "Mona Lisa" and Pablo Escobar. In 2000, Botero bequeathed over 200 works of art—including 123 of his own—to the Banco de la República, which are now housed in the Museo Botero in Bogotá.
