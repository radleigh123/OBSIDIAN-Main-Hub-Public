## Non-Responding Programs, Mouse, and Keyboard
- This might be caused by a variety of factors, such as faulty programs, your computer running out of resources, or faulty hardware. The best way to resolve this issue is to close the non-responding program and then to reopen it.
>[!ABSTRACT]- Example
>1. Open your computer’s _Start_ menu.
>2. Type in “task manager” and click the _Task Manager_ option. You should now see a new window open. (You can also open _Task Manager_ by pressing the _Ctrl_, _Shift_ and _Esc_ keys at the same time, or you can right click on the taskbar.)
>3. Select the program that is not responding. There will be a list of all the programs that are currently running on your computer. Scroll down and select the non-responding program.
>4. Click the _End Task_ button. This should close the non-responding program.
>5. Once the non-responding program has been closed, re-open it again.
