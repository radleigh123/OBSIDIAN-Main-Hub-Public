In the language of information-processing, a problem has <mark class="hltr-lightblue">3 components</mark>:
1. an initial state;
2. a set of permissible operations;
3. and a goal state.

| problems with each component is clear, and you can readily recognize when the problem is solved. | problems where any one, or all, of the 3 components is not well specified: |
|  | <mark class="hltr-lightblue">Initial state is vague</mark>, <mark class="hltr-lightblue">Operators are not well specified</mark>, <mark class="hltr-lightblue">Goal state is not clear</mark> |

### Problem-based learning (PBL)
deals with the latter type, the ill-structured, real-world problems. The process of solving such problems is difficult and complex.

- Engagement
	- students become interested in problem situation and begin posing questions that lead to investigation.
- Investigation
	- students explore a problem to extend their knowledge and skills. Toward the end of this phase, they from a problem statement.
- Resolution
	- students make a decision with regard to a solution and decide how best to represent their solution.
- Debriefing
	- students step outside problem to reflect and generalize both content and process.
