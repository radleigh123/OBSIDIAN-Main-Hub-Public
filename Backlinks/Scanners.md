## Scanners
- is an input device that works a lot like a photocopy machine. However, unlike a photocopy machine, a scanner does not produce a printed copy of the scanned document;<mark class="hltr-lightblue"> it produces a digital copy</mark> that you can save on your computer.
>[!INFO]-
>Scanners are often packaged with optical character recognition (OCR) software, which converts the text on the scanned document, called a portable document format (PDF), to text that can be used in a word-processing application. This makes it possible for the user to edit a scanned document.
>
>It should be noted that the effectiveness of OCR depends on the quality of the scanned document. Poor-quality scans will make it difficult for the software to function properly.
