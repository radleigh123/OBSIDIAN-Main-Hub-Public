## Wired Communication
Computer systems have different connections which usually depend on the motherboard's form factor.
>[!EXAMPLE]- Universal Serial Bus (USB)
> ![[Pasted image 20221018184135.png]]
>- is a connection/interface that allows the computer to communicate with system peripherals such as:
>	- keyboard
>	- mouse
>	- printer
>	- digital camers
>	- portable fans

>[!EXAMPLE]- FireWire
> ![[Pasted image 20221018184158.png]]
>- a type of connector that can transmit data to and from devices which have typical high data rates, such as:
>	- external hard drives
>>[!FAQ] FireWire is <u>faster than</u> that of a <u>USB</u>

>[!EXAMPLE]- Ethernet Cable
> ![[Pasted image 20221018184211.png]]
>- transmits signals between a computer and network devices, such as:

### Older computer units
>[!WARNING]- 15-pin Video Graphics Array (VGA) connector
> ![[Pasted image 20221018184241.png]]
>- has been provided on many video cards, computer monitors, laptop computers, and projectors.
>- phased out because **HDMI connector** is more compact and fast

>[!WARNING]- RS-232 Serial Connection
> ![[Pasted image 20221018184428.png]]
>- used for connections to modem, printer, mouse, and other peripheral devices
>- replaced by **USC connections**.

>[!WARNING]- Parallel Connections
> ![[Pasted image 20221018184536.png]]
>- similar to **serial connection**, used before to connect other compute peripherals
>- replaced by **USB connections**.

>[!WARNING]- PS/2
> ![[Pasted image 20221018184633.png]]
>- a 6-pin connector used to connect the mouse and keyboard to a computer
