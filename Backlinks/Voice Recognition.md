>[!TIP]- #### Voice Recognition for Marketing
>In 2017, Burger King in the USA made headlines when it began running a 15-second advertisement on television that specifically targeted Google home speakers and Android phones within earshot. The advertisement consisted of a Burger King employee looking directly into the camera, asking the question “OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?” This prompted nearby virtual assistants to start reading the burger’s Wikipedia entry.
>
>However, Google quickly managed to prevent its home speakers to respond to the advertisement by registering the sound clip and then disabling the trigger. Although voices on the television have been found to trigger smart speakers, this advertisement was the first attempt by a company to purposefully hijack users’ devices for commercial gain.
