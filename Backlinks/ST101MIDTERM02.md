# How computers interpret data
Depending on the standard used, computer systems convert characters from the keyboard and later display them on the monitor. Refer to the following steps:
1. From the keyboard, pressure pads are typically found underneath each key. Upon typing a letter, the pressure pad sends information to the CPU for processing.
2. The information is then transmitted in the form of 0s and 1s using the ASCII code.
3. The CPU determines what character has been typed and sends the information to the computer monitor, again in 0s and 1s.
4. The monitor displays the information in its equivalent character, this time readable and understandable by humans.

***ASCII*** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
- converting characters into 0s and 1s. The ASCII code is a 7-bit code used to represent letters, numbers, and basic special characters.

**Programs** - created by computer programmers to do specific tasks.
**Programmers** - people who write programs.
**Programming/Coding** - writing a program.

**Codes** - another term for a *program*.

To make it easier, machine codes are made "**more human**" by making them readable and similar to the human language.
