# Introduction to ICT

## Difference between ICT and IT
> **[IT](IT.md)** is a subset of **[ICT](ICT.md)** as the technology used in the field of **[IT](IT.md)** aids in the use of **[ICT](ICT.md)**

## Evolution of Technology
The evolution of technology has always depended on one thing: the **Human Rationale**.
#### Basic Tools
- starting concept of technology
#### Machines
- ==combination of tools== that people came up with, to do tasks faster and more efficiently

#### [Computer](INTCOMPrelimCh5.md)

		- "The technique of making an apparatus, a process, or a system to operate automatically"
		- [2 types of Automation](autoSystem.md)

## History of Computers
> Computer have evolved **based on the type of components used** in the design.

1. [1st Generation Computer (**1946**-1959)](1stGen.md)
2. [2nd Generation Computer (**1959**-1965)](2ndGen.md)
3. [3rd Generation Computer (**1965**-1971)](3rdGen.md)
4. [4th Generation Computer (**1971**-1980)](4thGen.md)
5. [5th Generation Computer (**1980**-onwards)](5thGen.md)

## Computer Hardware
- any part of the computer that can be seen and touched 
	- **[Input](Inputdevices.md)**
	- **[Output](Outputdevices.md)**
	- **[Storage](Storagedevices.md)**
	- **[Processing](Processingdevices.md)**
	- **[Communication](Communicationdevices.md)**

>**System Unit**
>- the enclosure composed of the main elements of a computer that are used to administer data
