> Aptly located in the dining hall of a Milanese convent, Da Vinci’s “Last Supper” is one of the most famous images in Western art, yet survives only thanks to intense restoration. Art aficionados wishing to get a glimpse of the 15-by-29-foot wall painting in person should book well in advance; admission is limited to small groups with viewings capped at just 15 minutes.
