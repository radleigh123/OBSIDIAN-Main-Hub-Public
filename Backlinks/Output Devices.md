>[!TIP] ## Output Devices
>- is any device that takes the data that has been stored on a computer and makes it available to the user.

>> [!BUG]- ### Computer Screen
>>- or **monitor** is the most important output device of any computer. It makes it possible for the user to visually interact with data and programs in a quick and easy manner.
>>> [!EXAMPLE] #### Evaluating a computer screen
>>> When looking to buy a new computer screen, there are three main things to look at:
>>>- **Pixels:** A good number of pixels is 1 920 pixels across the width of the monitor and 1 080 pixels across the height of the monitor. <mark class="hltr-lightblue">The higher the number of pixels, the better the screen.</mark>
>>>- **Screen size:** The size of a computer screen is measured diagonally from the bottom of the screen to the top right.
>>>- **Refresh rate:** This refers to the amount of time it takes for the screen to be updated with the newest information.
>>
>>>[!INFO]-
>>>Modern monitors can have up to 3 840 × 2 160 pixels (called “4K” resolution). This, however, can be an expensive purchase.

>>[!BUG]- ### Virtual Reality
>>- is one of the most exciting and interesting advances of technology. It is a type of output device that uses a specially designed headset to fully immerse the user in a high-quality 3D virtual world using both sight and sound.
>
>>[!BUG]- ### Speakers
>>-  are one of the most popular output devices. They play back the sound on your computer.
>>>[!EXAMPLE] #### Evaluating computer speakers
>>>The easiest option is to buy a set of computer speakers that you can just plug into the audio jack on the computer. Let’s take a look at some of the following tips of what to look for when you buy speakers:
>>>
>>>![[Pasted image 20221012175029.png]]
>>>- **Speakers with or without a subwoofer (2.0 or 2.1 speakers):** A **subwoofer** is a loudspeaker designed to reproduce low-frequency sound (for example, bass sounds).
>>>- **Specifications and sound quality:** The best way to evaluate the quality of sound produced by the speakers is to go and listen to them. If that is not possible, do your research on the internet and read the reviews of sources you trust. A good speaker system usually provides a good balance between the treble (high), mid-range and bass (low) frequencies; producing a full, rich sound while keeping the detail.
>>>- **Input:** Look for a system that gives you more than one audio-input jack so that you can also plug in your iPod, smartphone, or other audio devices.
>>>- **Control:** Although the systems that provide no control are the cheapest, it is better to get a system with at least a volume control. Some systems let you adjust the bass and treble levels as well. When you buy a system with more controls, make sure that they are easy to reach.
>>>- **Appearance:** Make sure that you like the way the speakers look, as you are going to see them whenever you are sitting at your computer.
>>>- **Price:** It is mostly true that the more you pay for speakers, the better they are. However, make sure that you shop around, as speakers are some of the most discounted computer accessories around.

>>[!BUG]- ### Printers
>>- is a device that makes it possible to transfer text and graphic output data from your computer to a piece of paper.
>>>[!EXAMPLE] #### Which printer is best for the task?
>>>-   **Speed:** Budget printers should be able to print about three to six colour pages per minute.
>>>- **Paper type and size:** Make sure to select a printer based on the type of documents you have to print.
>>>- **Printer resolution:** This is normally measured in dots per inch (dpi), and affects the sharpness of the text and images on the paper. A resolution of 600 dpi should be sufficient for the average user.
>>>- **Costs to print a page:** Colour printers are more expensive to operate and will cost more per page. This is also true for printers with a higher resolution.
>>>- **Memory:** All printers come with a limited amount of memory. Having more memory increases the speed at which printing takes place. This will only be noticeable if you are planning on printing pages with large images or tables on a regular basis.
>>>- **Wireless capabilities:** Most modern printers come with Wi-Fi capabilities. This makes it possible for the user to print documents without the need to be physically connected to the printer.
>>>- **Ink cartridges:** Make sure that ink cartridges are available for when you have to replace them.
