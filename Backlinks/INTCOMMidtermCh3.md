## Evaluating your Storage Device
When deciding to buy a new storage device, there are certain things that you must take into consideration. This includes the following:
-   Its **storage capacity**, which determines how much information you can save on the device.
-   Its **storage speed**, which determines how quickly new information can be written to the device, or read from the device.
-   Its **volatility**, which determines if the device will lose the data when turned off. You do not want a device that will lose all its data in case of a power outage.
-   Its **reliability and durability**, which determines how likely the device is to break down. When you store thousands of hours’ worth of work or years’ worth of photos on a storage device, you do not want it to break unexpectedly.
