> [!faq] # Unit 2.1 Buying the correct hardware
> When you want to buy a new computer, the most important thing to consider is _how_ you will be using the computer. Each computer has different specifications, advantages and limitations, which are linked to each of the components that you will use. A person who uses a computer exclusively for games will have different requirements to a person who needs a computer to browse the internet and do word processing.
> 
> To make it easier for you to decide on which components will work for you, we will be taking a look throughout this chapter at some of the things that you have to take into consideration before your next computer purchase.

## Productivity, Efficiency, Accuracy and Accessibility
Computers are one of the greatest technological advances of the modern era. They bring a variety of advantages, such as helping to improve productivity and efficiency by enabling the completion of difficult and time-consuming tasks in a fraction of the time it would take a human to complete. An example of this can be seen when looking at a factory that produces cars. It could take anything from two months to two years for a person to assemble a complete car. This same task can be completed within 8 hours by simply using a computer.

Computers can be programmed to perform a task in a very specific way. This not only ensures that the task is completed in the quickest way possible, but also that the task is completed as accurately as possible. Another example of computers helping with accuracy can be seen when looking at a database. The computer program allows you to use formulas and functions to do calculations. If you would have to complete these calculations on your own, it would take a significant amount of time and you could run the risk of making mistakes.

The last advantage of computers that we will be looking at is the increase in accessibility. In the past, people with disabilities were limited in the way that they could communicate and complete tasks. Fortunately, computers offer solutions to these problems. Computers not only allow disabled users to communicate with others (through the use of special input devices); they also enable them to perform basic functions, such as driving a car.
