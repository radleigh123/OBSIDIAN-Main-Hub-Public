##  Network Access Points (NAP)
is one or more locations with a high level of connectivity and several options to access the main carriers and content. They are essentially the points where different networks connect to each other to exchange data. In other words, this <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">allows customers of one [[NSP]]</mark> to communicate with <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">customers of another NSP</mark>, even if they are on different networks.

In it, different providers ([[ISP|ISPs]]) and telecommunications companies set up their **[[POP|Points of Presence]]** (POPs), allowing any business to easily use their connectivity services.

To lessen the traffic burden on the Internet’s backbone, major ISPs can connect their services directly to a NAP in the form of a “**peering arrangement**,” whereby traffic that needs to move between two ISPs connected to the same NAP can move directly from one ISP to the other instead of having to traverse the Internet’s backbone.
