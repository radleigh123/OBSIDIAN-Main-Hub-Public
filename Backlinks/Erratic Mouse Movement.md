## Erratic Mouse Movement
- is one of the most common issues that might occur when you use a mouse.
- This happens when your mouse pointer starts acting erratically, jumping across the screen and does not move properly.
>[!EXAMPLE] Let’s take a look at some of the possible causes and solutions to fix erratic mouse movements:
>- **The mouse is dirty:** The performance of an optical mouse might be affected by dirt inside the mouse. Removing the dirt by cleaning the mouse should fix the issue. Be sure to look up how to clean the mouse properly before you do it.
>- **Bad surface:** An irregular or shiny surface might interfere with the optical laser that is used by your mouse. This can be fixed by getting a mousepad or book to work on.
>- **Wireless mouse:** If you are using a wireless mouse, the issue might be caused by low battery power. Replacing the batteries should fix the issue.
