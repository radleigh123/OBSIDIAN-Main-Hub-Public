> Few paintings pack the political or emotional punch of “Guernica”—an anguished testament to the Nazi bombing of the eponymous Basque town at the request of Spanish Nationalists. Commissioned by the Spanish Republican Government for the 1937 Paris World’s Fair, the monumental canvas brought the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to international attention.
