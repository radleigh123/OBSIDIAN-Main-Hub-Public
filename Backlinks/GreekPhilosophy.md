| <mark class="hltr-blue">Study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence</mark>, especially in an <mark class="hltr-blue">academic discipline</mark> | As used originally by the ancient Greeks, the term "philosophy" <mark class="hltr-green">meant the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, and comprised ALL areas of speculative thought</mark>, including the <mark class="hltr-green">arts, sciences and religion</mark> |
| A particular theory that someone has about how to live or how to deal with a particular situation                                                                        | Philosophical questions (unlike those of the sciences) are usually foundational and abstract in nature. Philosophy is done primarily through reflection and does not tend to rely on experiment, although the methods used to study it may be analogous to those used in the study of the natural sciences |
| Academic discipline concerned with investigating the nature of significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs - investigates the legitimacy of concepts by rational argument concerning their implications, relationships as well as reality, knowledge, moral judgment, etc. |     |
