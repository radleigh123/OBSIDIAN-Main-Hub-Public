## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- is a specialized processing unit responsible for display functions. Like the CPU, the GPU is responsible for making calculations and following instructions.
- the GPU’s instructions are limited to the calculations needed to render and display images on the screen.

>In modern 3D games, thousands of objects can appear on the screen at the same time. Each object is a complex shape with its characteristics determined by using mathematical formulas. For example, to ensure that a 3D world looks realistic, the GPU may calculate thousands of beams of light that bounce around the world to create the light and shadows of the scene. This requires billions of calculations per second, and, as a result, GPUs often have more processing power than CPUs.

>[!EXAMPLE] Evaluating a GPU
>To find the correct product for your needs, you have to look at the manufacturer’s model numbers and benchmarks. Looking at the model number will provide you with an indication of which generation the card is, while the benchmarks will show you how powerful it is.

>With these model numbers, the X is replaced by a number that refers to the generation of the graphics card. For example, the GTX 980 was released in March 2015; while the GTX 1080 was released one year later in May 2016. This model was followed by the RTX 2080 that was released in September 2018.

>>The GPU is also referred to as the display adapter, graphics card, video adapter, video card, video controller or even gaming card.
