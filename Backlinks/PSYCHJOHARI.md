# Johari Window Model
The Johari window model is used to enhance the individual’s perception of others. This model is based on two ideas- trust can be acquired by revealing information about you to others and learning yourselves from their feedback. Each person is represented by the Johari model through four quadrants or window panes. Each four window panes signifies personal information, feelings, motivation and whether that information is known or unknown to oneself or others in four viewpoints.

## History
It is necessary to improve self-awareness and personal development among individuals when they are in a group. The ‘Johari’ window model is a convenient method used to achieve this task of understanding and enhancing communication between the members in a group. <mark class="hltr-blue">American psychologists Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham</mark> developed this model in <mark class="hltr-blue">1955</mark>. The idea was derived as the upshot of the <mark class="hltr-blue">group dynamics in University of California</mark> and was later improved by Joseph Luft. The name ‘Johari’ came from joining their first two names. This model is also denoted as a feedback/disclosure model of self-awareness.
## Model
The method of conveying and accepting feedback is interpreted in this model. A Johari is represented as a common window with four panes. Two of these panes represent self and the other two represent the part unknown to self but to others. The information transfers from one pane to the other as the result of mutual trust which can be achieved through socializing and the feedback got from other members of the group.
1. **Open/self-area, arena, or Public Self**
	1. Here the information about the person, his attitudes, behavior, emotions, feelings, skills and views will be known by the person as well as by others. This is mainly the area where all the communications occur and the larger the arena becomes the more effectual and dynamic the relationship will be. ‘Feedback solicitation’ is a process which occurs by understanding and listening to the feedback from another person. Through this way the open area can be increased horizontally decreasing the blind spot. The size of the arena can also be increased downwards and thus by reducing the hidden and unknown areas through revealing one’s feelings to another person. 
2. **Blind self or Blind Spot**
	1. Information about yourselves that others know in a group but you will be unaware of it. Others may interpret yourselves differently than you expect. The blind spot is reduced for efficient communication through seeking feedback from others. 
3. **Hidden area, façade, or Private Self**
	1. Information that is known to you but will be kept unknown from others. This can be any personal information which you feel reluctant to reveal. This includes feelings, past experiences, fears, secrets etc. we keep some of our feelings and information as private as it affects the relationships and thus the hidden area must be reduced by moving the information to the open areas. 
4. **Unknown area or Potential Self**
	1. The Information which are unaware to yourselves as well as others. This includes the information, feelings, capabilities, talents etc. This can be due to traumatic past experiences or events which can be unknown for a lifetime. The person will be unaware till he discovers his hidden qualities and capabilities or through observation of others. Open communication is also an effective way to decrease the unknown area and thus to communicate effectively.
