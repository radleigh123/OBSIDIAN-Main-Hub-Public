> This mosaic from the south gallery of Istanbul’s magnificent Hagia Sophia commemorates an important political alliance between East and West— the union of Emperor Komnenos and his redheaded Hungarian bride, Irene. Created from tiny, glittering glass tesserae, the image depicts the imperial couple presenting gifts to the central figures of the Virgin Mary and the infant Christ.
