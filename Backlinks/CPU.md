## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- is one of the most important parts of any computer. It is responsible for the following tasks:
	-   Receiving and carrying out the computer’s instructions
	-   Allocating more complicated tasks to other chips that will better handle the task

>[!EXAMPLE] ### Evaluating a CPU
>When trying to decide which CPU is best suited for your needs, you should consider the following:
>- **Gigahertz of the processor: Gigahertz** refers to the CPU frequency and is an indication of the processor’s speed. As a general guideline; the higher the frequency, the better the CPU.
>- **Number of cores:** As with the processor speed, generally more cores are better.

>Take note that even though the Core i7 is faster than the i5, it is also a lot more expensive. For the average user, this difference in speed will not be noticeable and as such, the i5 is much better value for your money.
