Welcome to the Beehive course on entrepreneurship. I‘m Marina and I‘m going to be your guide through this course.  
If you are interested, motivated, and curious about entrepreneurship, this course is for you!  
This course is a MOOC, or a massive open online course. This means you are embarking on a journey with a whole lot of other people. As we get into the course, you will have the opportunity to communicate with your fellow MOOC students. And, who knows, you may even make some new friends or business partners.  
There are all kinds of models of entrepreneurship out there, but I like to think about entrepreneurship as an exercise in juggling. Juggling takes skill and practice and the name of the game is to keep all the things you‘re juggling in the air. Similarly, entrepreneurs need to keep a lot of important things in mind and they can never let any of these things out of their sight. Together we are going to identify some of the things that a successful entrepreneur needs to juggle – to keep them in the air and keep them moving.  
Entrepreneurship isn‘t necessarily for everyone, but even if you don‘t become and entrepreneur, you are very likely to benefit from adopting an entrepreneurial mindset.
