# DNS (Domain Name Server)
$\,$▪ is the phonebook of the Internet.
$\quad$▪ translates domain names to IP addresses, e.g., **<u>Google.com</u>** ➡ becomes **<u>64.233.191.255</u>**

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as **192.168.1.1** (in **IPv4**), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as **2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2** (in **IPv6**).
