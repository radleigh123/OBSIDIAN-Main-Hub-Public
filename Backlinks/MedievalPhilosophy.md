# Medieval Philosophy
## St. Augustine of Hippo
- Augustine's view of the human person reflects the entire spirit of the medieval world when it comes man.
- Following the ancient view of [Plato](plato) and infusing it with the doctrine of Christianity, St. Augustine agreed that man is of a bifurcated nature.

> An aspect of man dwells in the world and is imperfect and continuously yearns to be with the Divine and the other is capable of reaching immortality.

> The body is bound to die on Earth and the soul is to anticipate living eternally in a realm of spiritual bliss in communion with God.

- This is because the body can only thrive in the imperfect, physical reality that is the world, whereas the soul can also stay after death in an eternal realm with the all-transcendent God.
- The goal of every human person is to attain this communion and bliss with the Divine by living his life on Earth in virtue.

## St. Thomas Aquinas
- the most eminent thirtieth century scholar and stalwart of the medieval philosophy, appended something to this Christian view.
- Adapting some ideas from Aristotle, Aquinas said that indeed, man is composed of two parts: 
	- Matter (hyle in Greek) - refers to the common stuff that makes up everything in the universe, man's body is part of this matter.
	- Form (morphe in Greek) - refers to the essence of a substance or thing. It is what makes it what it is.
- In the case of the human person, the body of the human person is something that he shares even with animals.
- The cells in man's body are more less akin to the cells of any other living organic being in the world.
- However, what makes a human person and not a dog, or a tiger is his soul, his essence.
- To Aquinas, just as in Aristotle, the soul is what animates the body; it is what makes us humans.
