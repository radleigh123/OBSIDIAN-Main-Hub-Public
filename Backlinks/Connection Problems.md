While network problems can be caused by a number of different devices, they are often easier to fix than hardware or software problems. Once a network has been set up correctly, most problems can be fixed by simply checking all the connections, restarting the affected computers and restarting the router. If this does not work, most ISPs have excellent support teams that should be able to assist you in resolving the problem.
