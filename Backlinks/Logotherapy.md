## Logotherapy
- A psychotherapy introduced by Dr. Viktor Frankl who is considered the Father of Logotherapy.
- Logotherapy's main belief is that "man's primary motivational force is search for meaning. "
- It aids individuals to find personal meaning of life, whatever life situation they may be
- It uses the philosophy of optimism in the face of tragedy, where people are capable of turning suffering into human achievement and accomplishment; deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and deriving from life's transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action
