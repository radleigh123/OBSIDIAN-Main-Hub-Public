# Common Software Problems
>[!FAQ]- Something to know
>- It is very important to install program updates, as it keeps your program running safely and efficiently.
>	- It also prevents others from exploiting your computer, as cybercriminals tend to target older, flawed versions of software that contain unpatched security flaws.

## Updating Software
- Developers are aware that you might not always be able to download every update as they come out.
	- To help with this, they might bundle together a number of update patches into a service pack.
	- Downloading this service pack will then update your software with all the missed patches.

## Read-only Files
- allows users to open and read the file, but no changes can be made to the file. This protects data from being changes on purpose or by accident.
- If you find that you cannot save or edit a file, it may be that the file had accidentally been changed to “read-only”. 
	- This problem might occur due to software updates that contain a faulty code. Despite this, software developers are quick to release updates to fix this issue.

>[!INFO] Sofware versioning
>-  is defined as a way to categorise the unique levels of computer software as it is developed and released.

>[!INFO] Software upgrade
>-  is a new version of the software that offers a major improvement over the current version of your software.

>[!FAQ]- Something to know
>- Software developers use read-only files by selling their software on CDs/ DVDs. 
>	- This allows you to install the program onto your computer, but will prevent you from making changes to the installation files on the CD/DVD.

## Risks of using Flawed Software
- **Security risks**
	- Faulty software might not be fully secure and can contain flaws that people with malicious intent can exploit in order to access your computer and steal your data.
- **Underperformance**
	- Faulty software might cause your computer to underperform due to slow system response and transaction rates.
- **No performance**
	- Faulty software can lead to program and computer crashes. This might require you to restart your computer.
- **Navigation risks**
	- Faulty software can cause programs that use a global positioning system (GPS) to give inaccurate results. This can lead to the user getting lost and wasting a lot of time trying to determine how to get to his or her destination.
- **Economical risks**
	- Faulty software used to make payments to workers can lead to some workers getting paid more than intended, while others might not get paid at all.
