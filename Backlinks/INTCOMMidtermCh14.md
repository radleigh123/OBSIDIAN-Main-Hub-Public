# Social Implications: User-centred design

## User-centered design (UCD)
- is a design process whereby the developers design software based on the focus and needs of the users.
- This involves a four-phase process:
	1. Identify how the user will use the product
	2. Determine the user’s requirements
	3. Design the product
	4. Evaluate the product according to the user’s needs, requirements and product performance

>	- Purpose of the database
>	- Type of data being stored
>	- Data fields required for data entry
>	- Data-validation techniques to protect data entry
>- UCD assists in making presentations easier to present and understand. This can be done in the following ways:
>	- Keep bullet points and text to a minimum
>	- Avoid using too many transitions
>	- Use high-quality images
