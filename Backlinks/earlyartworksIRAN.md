> Persian miniature master Sultan Muhammad is known for his exquisite manuscript illustrations, including this miniature depicting the Prophet Muhammad’s journey to heaven. Although the representation of human and animal forms was prohibited by Islam, exceptions were made for a small number of literary works. This remarkable manuscript was commissioned by Shah Tahmasp, who was also the artist’s pupil.
