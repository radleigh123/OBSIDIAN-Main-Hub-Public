# Software Enchancing Accessibility, Efficiency and Productivity
>[!DONE]- We will look at the following examples of software that make our lives easier:
>- Voice-recognition software
>- Typing tutor or keyboarding skills
>- Note-taking software
>- Cloud applications

## Voice-recognition Software
- or **speech-recognition software**, Â is a type of program that allows the computer to take verbal commands from the user and then interpret them.
>[!INFO]- Advantages of voice recognition
>- Helping people with physical disabilities to use a computer
