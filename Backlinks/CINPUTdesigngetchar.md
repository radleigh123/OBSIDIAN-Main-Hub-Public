## Designing your own input function using [`getchar()`](Cgetchar.md)
- As `scanf()` and `gets()` functions are risky to use. Hence, it is advisable to <mark class="hltr-lightblue">design your own input function</mark>.
- We want our input function to have following functionalities:
	- It must continue to read the string even after seeing white space characters
	- It must stop reading string after seeing the newline character
	- It must discard extra characters
	- And it must return the number of characters it sores in the character array
