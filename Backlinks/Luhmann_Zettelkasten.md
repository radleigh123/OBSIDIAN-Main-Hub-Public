#### Reference Notes
- The technique of grouping information, organizing ideas into categories, and creating tags to help you find grouped information at a later stage is the art of reference notes.
- Helpful ways to mark reference notes include applying a **hashtag**

#### Permanent Notes
- are stand-alone ideas that can be made without any direct context to other sourced information such as books, videos, or other available data.
- The aim of permanent notes is to process the notes you have made and analyze how they affect your interests, thinking, and research.

#### Fleeting Notes
- are unstructured and unorganized notes
- temporary reminders of ideas
