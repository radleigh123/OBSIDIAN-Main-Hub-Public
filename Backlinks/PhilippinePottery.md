## Pottery
- the most convenient approach to the pre-hispanic pottery is to classify them by shape, method of decoration, and type of design used in the surface.
- Shape refers to the description of the vessels of the body.<mark class="hltr-blue"> The form of its mouth, the thickness of its lips, and the presence of the ears, spouts and legs</mark> applied to its body. 
- Method of decoration is the manner by which designs are applied on the bodyâ€™s surface. The decorative designs are either <mark class="hltr-blue">impressed or incised</mark>.
