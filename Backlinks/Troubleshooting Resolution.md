>- The screen is not plugged into the computer. Plugging in the screen should fix this issue.
>- The setting of the screen resolution is too high. Operating systems, such as Windows, have a built-in feature that allows you to return to your previous resolution 15 seconds after you selected a new one. Just make sure that you do not click on _Keep these changes_.
>- The images and text on the screen look very big. This is most likely because the resolution is very low and changing the resolution should fix the problem. This issue is sometimes caused when updating your computer’s graphics drivers.
