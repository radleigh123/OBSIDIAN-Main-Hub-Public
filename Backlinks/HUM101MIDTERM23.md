- Fabian de la Rosa and Fernando Amorsolo (Father of the Philippine Painting) influenced the art with their landscape and genre paintings (household scenes)
- During the Japanese occupation, painting was at halt. Due to low entry, an exhibition in which artists were requested to depict "The New Philippines" did not take place.
