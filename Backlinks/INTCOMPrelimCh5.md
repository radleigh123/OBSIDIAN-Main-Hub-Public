## 4 Primary Operations of a Computer
1. **Input** - entering data into the computer
2. **Processing** - performing operations on the data
3. **Output** - presenting the results
4. **Storage** - saving data, programs, or output for future use

## The Information Processing Cycle
- **IPOS (Information Processing Cycle)**
	- progression of input, processing, output, and storage
- In addition to these four primary computer operations, today’s ==computers almost always perform [communications functions](commfun.md)==, such as sending or retrieving data via the Internet, accessing information located in a shared company database, or exchanging data or e-mail messages with others.
