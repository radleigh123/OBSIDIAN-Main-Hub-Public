# Risks of a Technology-Oriented Society
- Although there are a great number of benefits from having a technology-oriented society, there are risks as well. A variety of problems have emerged from our extensive use of computers and related technology.

- **Proliferation of Spam (Unsolicited E-mails)**
	- Using your primary e-mail address when shopping online or signing up for a sweepstake or other online activity will undoubtedly result in spam being sent to that e-mail address.
- **Security Issues**
	- Your computer becoming infected with a malware program.
	- Identity Theft and Phishing
- **Privacy Issues**
	- How collected data is used
	- How secure the collected data is
- **Differences in Online Communications**
	- Less formal than traditional communications
- **Netiquette**
	-   Be polite and considerate of others  
	-   Refrain from offensive remarks
	-   With business communications, you should be very careful with your grammar and spelling to avoid embarrassing yourself.
- **The Anonymity Factor**
	- By their very nature, online communications lend themselves to anonymity. Because recipients usually do not hear sendersâ€™ voices or see their handwriting, it is difficult to know for sure who the sender is. Particularly in online discussions, online worlds, and other online activities where individuals use made-up names instead of real names, there is an anonymous feel to being online.
- **Information Integrity**
	- The Web contains a vast amount of information on a wide variety of topics. While much of the information is factual, other information may be misleading, biased, or just plain wrong. As more and more people turn to the Web for information, it is crucial that they take the time to determine if the information they obtain and pass on to others is accurate. There have been numerous cases of information intended as a joke being restated on a Web site as fact, statements being quoted out of context (which changed the meaning from the original intent), and hoaxes circulated via e-mail. Consequently, use common sense when evaluating what you read online, and double-check information before passing it on to others.

	- One way to evaluate online content is by its source. If you obtain information from a news source that you trust, you should feel confident that the accuracy of its online information is close to that of its offline counterpart. For information about a particular product, go to the originating company. For government information, government Web sites are your best source for fact checking. There are also independent Web sites (such as the Snopes.com Web site ) that report on the validity of current online rumors and stories.
