# Browsing the Web
- **Browser**
	- is software that <mark class="hltr-blue">enables users</mark> with an Internet connection <mark class="hltr-blue">to access and view webpages on a [computer](INTCOMPrelimCh5.md)</mark> or mobile device
	- Some widely used browsers include *Chrome*, *Edge*, *Firefox*, *Safari*, and *Opera*.
### How to use a Browser to Display a Webpage (VERY SIMPLE)
1.  Run a browser.
2.  If necessary, click the address bar to select it and any previously displayed web address it may contain. (A web address is a unique address that identifies a webpage.)
3.  In the address bar, type the web address of the webpage you want to visit and then press the enter key or click the Go (or similar) button to display the webpage. For example, [www.plantationbay.com](http://www.plantationbay.com/) is a valid web address, which displays Plantation Bay's webpage. 
4.  If necessary, scroll to view the entire webpage. You can scroll either by sliding your finger across a touch screen or by using a pointing device, such as a mouse, to drag the scroll bar.
5.  Click links on the webpage to navigate to the link’s destination.
