> is characterized by an attitude of skepticism, irony, or rejection toward the meta-narratives and ideologies o f modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of Enlightenment rationality.

- Posits a fragmented self that has no essence, only images. Jameson (1984) argues that the simple and indivisible ego-self existed at one time, during the period of classical capitalism and the nuclear family, but has come to an end in the postmodern era.
- The postmodern self is fragmented and decentered with a kind of emotional flatness or depthlessness. According to Gergen(1991), postmodern culture erases the category of self.

- Goffman's work has been interpreted as a precursor to postmodernism sociology (Battershill 1990). Goffman certainly can be considered the theorist par excellence of the situated self. It is generally accepted that Goffman theorized a self that is created in an encounter: "The self... is a dramatic effect arising diffusely from a scene that is presented.
