	- was canonized by the Catholic Church in the fourteenth century

### Conclusion
- Therefore, the Medieval perspective on  the Self was greatly influenced by religion.
- The theocentric approach of the medieval philosophy relegated the self to secondary concern. God and faith in Him is primary, while the self is secondary because the self-owed its origin from God. Man is a creature made by God according to His image and likeness to know, love, and fulfil His purpose and to share His everlasting glory. Human truth is subordinate to divine truth. Divine truth must be accepted by faith and is beyond the power of human reason to prove. Since faith is fundamental, human reason is meant to strengthen the faith.
