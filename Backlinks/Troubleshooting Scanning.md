## Scanning
- Scanning a document does not always produce the expected result. 
	>[!EXAMPLE] **A skew or cut-off scanned document:**
	>This is caused by a document that is not properly aligned. To fix it, reposition the document on the scanner.

	>[!EXAMPLE] **Poor image quality:** 
	>This can be due to two reasons:
	>- Caused by a dirty scanner surface: Cleaning the surface should resolve the issue.
	>- Caused by the inability of the OCR software to read the text: This can be fixed by making sure that the document you want to scan is clear and readable.
	
	>[!EXAMPLE] **Connection errors:** 
	>This is most likely caused due to a poorly attached connection. Make sure to properly connect the scanner to fix the issue.
