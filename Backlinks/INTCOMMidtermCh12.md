# Interpreting System Requirements
>[!FAQ]- Something to know
>- **System requirements** are guidelines; not absolute rules. If your hardware does not meet the system requirements, it does not mean that the software will not work.
>	- However, there is a good chance that the software will perform very poorly and might stop working in the middle of the process.

## System Requirements of Software

### System Requirements
- refer to a list of hardware and software requirements that the software will need in order to function. The list will normally include:
	- **minimum** (the lowest specifications needed to let the program work)
	- **recommended** (the specifications where the program should function best)
- Hardware requirements for the software
	- The amount of hard-drive space needed to install the software
	- The amount of RAM needed for the software to function normally
	- The GPU and CPU required to do calculations
	- The type of programs (usually the type of operating system) that is required for the new program to function
	- The input and output device needed for data to be collected and displayed
