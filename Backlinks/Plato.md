## Plato (427-347 BC)
#### 3 Components to the Soul
[1. Rational soul](PSYCHPrelimRATIONAL.md)
[2. Spirited soul](PSYCHPrelimSPIRIT.md)
[3. Appetitive soul](PSYCHPrelimAPPETITIVE.md)

#### The Republic
- It is one of the longest works of Plato. (more than 450 pages in length).
- It is written in dialogue form (as are most of Plato‚Äôs books), & it addresses major issues in almost all of the branches of philosophy.
- The selection in the text begins at a point in the Republic after Socrates, Glaucon, & other characters have been discussing the nature of justice and the marks of a just political system for some time.

#### According to [[Socrates]](Plato), a true philosopher...
- Loves the whole of wisdom and is satisfied with nothing less;
- Recognizes the difference between particular things and the essences (or forms) of which particular things are likenesses (e.g., beautiful things vs. Beauty itself); and
- Knows the differences between knowledge, ignorance, and opinion.

#### Plato argues that...
- Someone who really loves something must love that thing as a whole and not just some aspects of it. On that basis, he concludes that a true philosopher (lover of wisdom) <mark class="hltr-green">must desire wisdom as a whole and not be content with having just some wisdom</mark>.
