# Prehistoric Art (35,000 BC - Early centuries of AD)
> is all art produced in preliterate, pre-historical cultures beginning somewhere in very late geological history, and generally continuing until that culture either develops writing or other methods of record-keeping, or it makes significant contact with another culture that has.

- The very <mark class="hltr-blue">earliest human artifacts</mark> showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purposes are those from <mark class="hltr-blue">the Paleolithic through the Mesolithic Era Cave paintings</mark> and portable art like figurines and beads predominated, with decorative figured workings also seen on some utilitarian objects.
- In the <mark class="hltr-blue">Neolithic</mark> evidence of <mark class="hltr-blue">early pottery appeared</mark>, as did sculpture and the construction of megaliths.

- The <mark class="hltr-blue">advent of metalworking in the Bronze Age</mark> brought another increase in mediums used for art, an <mark class="hltr-blue">increase in stylistic diversity</mark>, and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art.
- By the <mark class="hltr-blue">Iron Age</mark>, civilizations with <mark class="hltr-blue">writing</mark> had arisen from <mark class="hltr-blue">Ancient Egypt to Ancient China</mark>.
