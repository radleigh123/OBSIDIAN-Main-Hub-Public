Community Organizing as a process is described as:
- Collective
- Participatory
- Systematic
- Sustained
- Transformative/Liberative

### Organizing Approaches
Issue - based Approach
- refers to an organizing approach which revolves around issues/problems that:
	a. Are felt by a significant number of people in the community
	b. Require the people to negotiate from a position of strength in number with a target group, usually outside the community, for issue resolution
	c. Have a high probability of being resolved if a collectively acted upon.
Socio-Economic- Projects based Approach
- this CO approach centers around the introduction of socio-economic projects, such as health care, income generating projects, enterprise development, credit/marketing/production/multi-purpose cooperative formation, etc., that are identified by the CO with the community after a study of the felt needs of the community, or are pre-packaged by the funding source based on their perceived needs of the community.
The Church/Faith - based Approach
- used by organizers within the structures of the Church or within components of Church based programs.

### Principles of Community Organization and Practices
CO operates on several principles which can be condensed into the following:
1. It is rooted in the local indigenous leadership, the local organizations and agencies, and in short, in the local people.
2. It aims not just towards helping communities to solve their day-to-day problems, but ultimately towards national social transformation.
3. It recognizes and respects the primary role of the people in the task of social transformation.
4. It recognizes that genuine transformation can be affected only through the people’s collective strength.
5. It involves learning through praxis, i.e., the continuing refinement of theory and understanding through experiences.
6. Using the people’s felt needs as a starting point for organizing.
7. Using the collective process in most important problem solving, decision making and planning activities with the people.
8. Developing local leaders who will eventually perform the tasks of the community organizer.
9. Establishing open and legal CO with publicly known leaders, members and activities.
10. Avoiding the imposition of ideology on the people.
