# Immanuel Kant
> He worked to synthesize what seemingly were different perspectives in the acquisition of knowledge: **experience** and **reason**.

## View of the Self
- Is a response to Hume’s position of the absence of self. He acknowledges the role that sensory experience plays in knowing about the world, as argued by Hume. However, instead of maintaining Hume’s position that the experiences are disjoint fleeting sensations, Kant argues that the organized and connected experiences of the world are fairly stable.

## Where is the Self?
- Kant assume as a fact that the Self makes a person's sensory experience understandable and meaningful. It is the organizing entity, the weaver, the music conductor, or the architect that puts it all together.
