## Operating System
The OS allows a person to interact with the computer from the hardware components and peripherals to all the installed sofware applications and files one has stores on the computer. The interaction can occure in two ways:
1. By using command-line operating system (e.g. DOS or CMD) in which the computer responds according to the text command that is typed.
2. With a graphical user interface (GUI) operating system (e.g. Windows) such as picture and buttons through mouse clicks and keyboard entries.
