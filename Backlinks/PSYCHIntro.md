# Understanding the Self
The terms "self" and "identity" have been loosely interchanged in various literature.
- **Identity** > is the quality, beliefs that make a particular person different from others.
- **Self** > refers to the entire person of an individual.

### Nature VS Nurture
- **Nature** > some insist that the self is predominantly a product of natural processes to which people are inherently predisposed
- **Nurture** > the other side, meanwhile, argues that the self should be principally viewed as an outcome of various nurturing factors in the context of one's life.
