>The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a 19th-century English aesthetic movement, were drawn to religious and literary subjects painted in a highly realistic manner. Waterhouse’s “The Lady of Shalott” illustrates a verse from Tennyson’s 1832 poem based on a medieval Arthurian legend. The landscape was painted by the artist en plein air in the English countryside.
