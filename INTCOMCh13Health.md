# Health Care
- Nearly every area of health care today uses computers. Whether you are visiting a family doctor for a regular checkup, having lab work or an outpatient test, filling a prescription, or being rushed in for emergency surgery, the medical staff around you will be using computers for various purposes:
	-   Hospitals and doctors use computers and mobile devices to maintain and access patient records (see figure below)
	-   Doctors, nurses, technicians, and other medical staff use computers and computerized devices to assist with medical tests.
	-   Computers and mobile devices monitor patients’ vital signs in hospital rooms and at home; patients use computers to manage health conditions, such as diabetes.
	-   Robots deliver medication to nurses’ stations in hospitals.
	-   Computers and computerized devices assist doctors, nurses, and technicians with medical tests.
	-   Doctors use the web and medical software to assist with researching and diagnosing health conditions.
	-   Doctors use email, text messaging, and other communications services to correspond with patients.
	-   Patients use computers and mobile devices to refill prescriptions, and pharmacists use computers to file insurance claims and provide customers with vital information about their medications.
	-   Surgeons implant computerized devices, such as pacemakers, that allow patients to live longer.
	-   Surgeons use computer-controlled devices to provide them with greater precision during operations, such as for laser eye surgery and robot-assisted heart surgery.
	-   Medical staff use virtual reality (VR) to simulate education and training environments, such as for practicing surgeries, and patients use VR for recovery treatments, such as in rehabilitation and behavior therapy.
	-   Medical staff create labels for medicine, hospital ID bracelets, and more, enabling staff to verify dosage and access patient records by scanning the label.
