# Finance
- Many people and companies use online banking or finance software to pay bills, track personal income and expenses, manage investments, and evaluate financial plans. The difference between using a financial institutions’ website versus finance software on your computer is that all your account information is stored on the bank’s computer instead of your computer. The advantage is you can access your financial records from anywhere in the world.
