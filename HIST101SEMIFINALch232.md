What is secularization Movement? What was the cause of that movement?
led by the GOMBURZA
This movement demanded the handling over of the parishes from the regular clergy ( Dominicans, Franciscans, Recollects etc.), who were Spanish friars, <mark class="hltr-lightblue">to secular priests</mark>, most of whom <mark class="hltr-lightblue">were Filipinos</mark>. ^6a4f97

The secularization movement encouraged the assignment of native Filipino priests to head parishes. The movement was met with opposition from the <mark class="hltr-lightblue">Spanish friars who are regulars due to its negative effects to their political authority and influence</mark> in the Philippine islands. Some religious regulars justified their opposition from give native priests more responsibility with racist reasoning, that natives are not suitable for priesthood to begin with. They were also concerned that the secularization process might lead to secession of the island colony from Spain.

Cause:
The [[HIST101Seculars|seculars]] were those who were not bound by monastic vows or rules.
Filipino priests were then not accepted by the regular clergy, and were mostly assigned as assistants to Spanish friars

Effect:
The [[HIST101GOMBURZA|GomBurZa]] was implicated in the [[HIST101CaviteMutiny|Cavite Mutiny]] and was executed through Garrote
