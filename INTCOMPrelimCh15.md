# Benefits of a Technology-Oriented Society
- The capability to virtually design, build, and test new buildings, cars, and airplanes before the actual construction begins helps professionals create safer end products
- Technology has made a huge number of tasks in our lives go much faster, like:  

	- Instead of experiencing a long delay for a credit check, an applicant can get approved for a purchase, loan, or credit card almost immediately.
	- Documents and photographs can be e-mailed in mere moments, instead of taking at least a day to be mailed physically.
	- We can watch many of our favorite TVs shows online and access up-to-the-minute news at our convenience.
	- We can download information, programs, music files, movies, and more on demand when we want or need them, instead of having to order them and then wait for delivery or physically go to a store to purchase the desired items.
