**Purpose of Expedition**
Alvaro de Saavedra's 1527 expedition aimed to discover a new trade route from the Americas to the Spice Islands, bypassing the Portuguese monopoly, while exploring new territories for Spain and spreading Christianity. Although he did not find the desired route, his exploration of the Tuvalu and Solomon Islands contributed to the understanding of the Pacific islands and their inhabitants, making his expedition an important event in the history of exploration, trade, and religious spreading in the Pacific region.

**Result of Expedition**
Alvaro de Saavedra's expedition of 1527 did not achieve its primary goal of finding a new trade route to the Spice Islands. However, it contributed significantly to the growing knowledge of the Pacific islands and their inhabitants. Saavedra explored the Tuvalu and Solomon Islands, named many of the islands he discovered after religious figures, and made valuable observations about the people and their customs.

Additionally, the expedition helped to establish Spain's presence in the Pacific region, contributing to the Spanish colonization and Christianization of the area. While the expedition did not achieve its primary objective, it paved the way for future Spanish explorers, who would continue to expand Spain's influence in the Pacific region over the following centuries.
