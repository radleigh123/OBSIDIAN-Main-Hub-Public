# Operators
An operator is simply a symbol that is used to perform operations. There are following types of operators:
- [[COPERATORSbinary|Binary Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSunary|Unary Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSarithmetic|Arithmetic Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSrelational|Relational Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSshift|Shift Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSlogical|Logical Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSbitwise|Bitwise Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSternary|Ternary or Conditional Operators]]
- [[COPERATORSassignment|Assignment Operator]]
- [[COPERATORSmiscellaneous|Misc Operator]]

## Precedency and Associativity
>[!column|no-t flex]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse ttl-c txt-c] Precedence
>> is used to determine the order of operators evaluated in an expression.

>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse ttl-c txt-c] Associativity
>> is used to determine the order of operators with equal precedence evaluated in an expression

>[!EXAMPLE|alt-co]- An `expression evaluation`
> ![[CMISCsample1.svg|center cover wm-sm]]

>[!EXAMPLE|alt-co]- Parenthesis in [[Cfunctions|function]] calls
> ![[CMISCsample2.svg|center cover wm-tl]]

>[!CHECK|alt-co no-i ttl-c] Takeaways
>- Associativity can only help if there are 2 or more operators of same precedence and not when there is just one operator
>- Operators with same precedence, have same associativity as well
