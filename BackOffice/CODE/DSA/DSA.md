## Complexities
The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently. This is measured by complexities:
1. [[DSATimeComplexity|Time Complexity]]: Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
2. [[DSASpaceComplexity|Space Complexity]]: Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code. 
> You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.

**Asymptotic Notation**
is a mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of the code. It neglects the system-dependent constants and is related to only the number of modular operations being performed in the whole program.
1. [[DSABigO|Big-O Notation (O)]] – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
2. [[DSAOmega|Omega Notation (Ω)]] – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
3. [[DSATheta|Theta Notation (θ)]] – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
