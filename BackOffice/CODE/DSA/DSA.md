# Data Structures and Algorithms
**Data Structure**
A data structure is defined <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">as a particular way of storing and organizing data</mark> in our devices to <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">use the data efficiently and effectively</mark>. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

**Algorithm**
Algorithm is defined as <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">a process or set of well-defined instructions</mark> that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

>[!SUCCESS|ttl-c] Qualities of a good algorithm
>- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output
>- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
>- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code instead;
>	- should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.
>- Algorithms should produce a result.
