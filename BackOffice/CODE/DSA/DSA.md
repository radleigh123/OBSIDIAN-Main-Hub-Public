# Data Structures and Algorithms
**Data Structure**
A data structure is defined <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">as a particular way of storing and organizing data</mark> in our devices to <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">use the data efficiently and effectively</mark>. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

**Algorithm**
Algorithm is defined as <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">a process or set of well-defined instructions</mark> that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

>[!SUCCESS|ttl-c] Qualities of a good algorithm
>- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output
>- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
>- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code instead;
>	- should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.
>- Algorithms should produce a result.

## Complexities
**Time and Space Complexities**
The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently. This is measured by complexities:
1. [[DSATimeComplexity|Time Complexity]]: Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
2. [[DSASpaceComplexity|Space Complexity]]: Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code. 

> You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.

**Asymptotic Notation**
is a mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of the code. It neglects the system-dependent constants and is related to only the number of modular operations being performed in the whole program.
1. [[DSABigO|Big-O Notation (O)]] – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
2. [[DSAOmega|Omega Notation (Ω)]] – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
3. [[DSATheta|Theta Notation (θ)]] – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
