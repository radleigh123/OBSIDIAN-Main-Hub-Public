# Algorithm
Algorithm is defined as <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">a process or set of well-defined instructions</mark> that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

Based on the type of nature and usage, the Algorithms are grouped together into several categories, as shown below:
- [[DSAAlgorithmSorting|Sorting algorithm]]
- [[DSAAlgorithmSearching|Searching algorithm]]
