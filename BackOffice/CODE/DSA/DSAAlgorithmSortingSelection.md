## Selection Sort
a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

```java
int[] arr = { 64, 25, 12, 22, 11 };

int n = arr.length;
 
// One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray
for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
{
	// Find the minimum element in unsorted array
	int min_idx = i;
	for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
		if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
			min_idx = j;

	// Swap the found minimum element with the first
	// element
	int temp = arr[min_idx];
	arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
	arr[i] = temp;
}
```
