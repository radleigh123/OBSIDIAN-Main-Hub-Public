## Relative URL
Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name.
**If the URL begins w/out a slash, it will be relative to the current page.**

```HTML
<img src="img_boy.png">
```

**IF the URL begins w/ a slash, it will be relative to the domain.**
```HTML
<img src="/images/img_boy.png">
```

>[!NOTE]
>- It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain
