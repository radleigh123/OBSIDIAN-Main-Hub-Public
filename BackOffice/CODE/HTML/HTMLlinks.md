> ```

it specifies where to open the linked URL, can have one of the following values:
- `_self`: Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
- `_blank`: Opens the document in a new window/tab
- `_parent`: Opens the document in the parent frame
- `_top`: Opens the document in the full body of the window

Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Absolute URL - Full web address, in the `href` attribute
Relative URL - Local link, a link to a page within the same website (w/out the "https://www" part)
```HTML
<!-- Absolute URL --->
<p><a href="https://www.google.org/">Goggles</a></p>

<!-- Relative URL --->
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">Go Home</a></p>
```

Image Links
To use an image as a link, just put the `<img>` tag inside the `<a>` tag
```HTML
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="image.gif" alt="a girl" style="width:50%">
</a>
```

Link to an Email Address
Use the `mailto:` inside the `href` attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program
```HTML
<a href="mailto:name@example.com">Send sauce</a>
```

Button Links
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some **[[JAVASCRIPT|JavaScript code]]**.
```HTML JavaScript
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">Sample World</button>
```

Title Links
The `title` attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
```HTML
<a href="https://www.google.com/" title="To me charot">Sample Title</a>
```
