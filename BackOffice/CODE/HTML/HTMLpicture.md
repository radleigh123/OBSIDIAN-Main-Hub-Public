## Picture element `<picture>`
The `<picture>` tag gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.

The most common use of the `<picture>` element will be for art direction in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.

>[!TIP|alt-co]+ Tip:
> The `<picture>` element works "similar" to `<video>` and `<audio>`. You set up different sources, and the first source that fits the preferences is the one being used.
