# Wild Card `*`

>[!WARNING|ttl-c collapse]
> It is generally a good practice to avoid using the wildcard **\*** and to import only the specific [[JavaClass&Object|classes]] and [[JavaInterface|interfaces]] that you need. This can make it easier to understand where each class and interface comes from and can prevent naming conflicts that can arise when two or more [[JavaPackages|packages]] have classes with the same name.
