# Wildcards
The question mark `?` is known as the *wildcard* in generic programming. It <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">represents an unknown type</mark>.

Generic-type bounding allows us to restrict what types can be used instead of the generic type. This Java feature makes it possible to treat generics polymorphically. For instance, a method that operates on numbers might only want to accept instances of the Number class or its subclasses. This is what bounded type parameters are for.
