## `CardLayout` class
lets you implement an area that contains different components at different times. A *CardLayout* is often controlled by a [[JavaGUISwingJComboBox|combo box]], with the state of the combo box determining which [[JavaGUISwingJPanel|panel]] (group of components) the *CardLayout* displays.

An alternative to using *CardLayout* is using a [[JavaSwingJTabbedPane|tabbed pane]], which provides similar functionality but with a pre-defined GUI.
