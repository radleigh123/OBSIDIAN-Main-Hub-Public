# JavaFX
is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems built on Java. It is a fully featured toolkit for developing **Rich Client Applications** or **Rich Internet Applications** (**RIA**).

**JavaFX Applications**
Since the JavaFX library is written as a Java API, JavaFX application code can reference APIs from any Java library. For example, JavaFX applications can use Java API libraries to access native system capabilities and connect to server-based middleware applications.

The look and feel of JavaFX applications can be customized. [[CSS|Cascading Style Sheets]] (`CSS`) separate appearance and style from implementation so that developers can concentrate on coding. Graphic designers can easily customize the appearance and style of the application through the CSS.
- If you have a web design background, or if you would like to separate the user interface (UI) and the back-end logic, then you can develop the presentation aspects of the UI in the **FXML scripting language** and use Java code for the application logic.
- If you prefer to design UIs without writing code, then use **JavaFX Scene Builder**. As you design the UI, Scene Builder creates FXML markup that can be ported to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) so that developers can add the business logic.
