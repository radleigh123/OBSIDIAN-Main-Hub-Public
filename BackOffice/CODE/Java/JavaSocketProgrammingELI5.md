**[[JavaSocketProgrammingWhy|BACK]]**

Okay, imagine you have two phones, one is your phone and the other is your friend's phone. You want to talk to your friend, but your phones are not close to each other. So, what do you do? You make a call!

Similarly, in Java, Socket programming is a way for two different programs (like your phone and your friend's phone) to talk to each other over the internet (like making a call). In this case, the programs are usually running on different computers connected to the internet.

One program acts as a "client" and the other program acts as a "server". The client program sends a message to the server program using a "socket" (like a phone call). The server program receives the message and sends a response back to the client program using the same socket.

This process can happen over and over again, with the client and server taking turns sending messages to each other until they're done talking. This is how programs can communicate with each other over the internet using Java!
