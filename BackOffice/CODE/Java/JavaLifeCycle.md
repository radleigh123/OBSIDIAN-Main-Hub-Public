## The Life Cycle of a Java Program
![[Pasted image 20230203183218.png|center wm-tl cover]]
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are different types of programming languages. In some of them you write the text of the program (aka the source code) and can execute this program right away. These are interpreted languages (e.g., [[JavaScript]]).

But Java requires the source code of your program to be compiled first. It gets converted to either machine-specific code or a bytecode that is understood by some run-time engine or a virtual machine. Not only will the program be checked for syntax errors by a Java compiler, but some other libraries of Java code can be added (linked) to your program after the compilation is complete (deployment stage).
