## `Vector` Class
![[JavaVector.png|center ws-med]]

is a data structure that is used to store a collection of elements. Elements can be of all [[JavaVariables#^3c12e4|primitive types]] like `int`, `float`, `Object` etc. Vectors are dynamic in nature and accordingly grow or shrink as per the requirement.

>[!WARNING|alt-co ttl-c]+
> *Vectors* thread-safety comes at the cost of performance, so Vectors are generally <u>not recommended for applications that require high performance or low memory usage</u>.
