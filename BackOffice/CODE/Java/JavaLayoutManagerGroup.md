## `GroupLayout` class
is a layout manager that was developed for use by GUI builder tools, but it can also be used manually. *GroupLayout* works with the horizontal and vertical layouts separately. The layout is defined for each dimension independently. Consequently, however, each component needs to be defined twice in the layout.
