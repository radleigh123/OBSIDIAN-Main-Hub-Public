## Terminologies
- **I/O Stream**- It is a sequence of data/objects that supports various methods. They are used to read or write data. Eg- files, input-output devices etc.
- **Input Stream Reader**- It reads data from a source, one item at a time. An `InputStreamReader` class is a bridge from byte streams to character streams. It reads bytes and decodes them into characters.
- **Output Stream Writer**- It writes data to a destination, one item at a time. An `OutputStreamWriter` class is a bridge from character streams to byte streams. Characters written to it are encoded into bytes.
- **Unicode** is an international character encoding standard by which each letter, digit or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value across all platforms.
- **Non-Unicode text** are modules or character encodings that do not support Unicode standards. It only supports English language representation.
