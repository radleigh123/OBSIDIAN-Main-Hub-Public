## Debugging Java Programs
**bug** - is an error in a program that causes the program to work in an unexpected way.

>[!CITE|alt-co ttl-c] To **debug** a program is to identify and fix the run-time errors in code.

Java also comes with a logging **[[JavaAPI|API]]** (**application program interface**) that allows you to log the run-time values in a file or other destination. You can find `Logger` and other supporting classes in the Java package `java.util.logging`.
