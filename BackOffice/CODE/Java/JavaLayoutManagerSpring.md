## `SpringLayout` class
is a flexible layout manager designed for use by GUI builders. It lets you specify precise relationships between the edges of components under its control. 

For example, you might define that the left edge of one component is a certain distance (which can be dynamically calculated) from the right edge of a second component. *SpringLayout* lays out the children of its associated container according to a set of constraints.
