- response
- close

**Uniform Resource Locators** (URLs)- which is sorted as the <mark class="hltr-blue">Internet address</mark>. A URL contains four parts:

#### Searching for Information of the Web
**Web Administrator** - A website is maintained by its owner

There are two mainly managed search tools that people use in locating information on the web:
- [subject directories](ST101SEMIFINAL6subjectdirectories.md)
- [search engines](ST101SEMIFINAL6searchengines.md)

>[!TIP]- Google search tricks
>1. **Use quotes to search for an exact phrase** - By typing in double-quotes (“) at the start and end for a certain word or phrase, Google will provide the exact word or phrasing you need.
>2. **Use an asterisk within quotes to specify unknown or variable words** - the asterisk symbol (\*) will provide possibilities. It is helpful, for example, if you are trying to determine a song from its lyrics, but you forgot some of the words or if you are trying to complete a sentence, but could not remember what it was.
>3. **Use the minus sign to eliminate results containing certain words** - While the asterisk gives you possibilities, the minus sign (-) eliminates results of certain words. Just type the minus sign prior to the word you do not want to include in the search.
>4. **Search websites for keywords** - You can specify certain content, format, or files you want Google search to provide. For instance, if you want to specifically search for PDF files regarding a certain topic, simply type the keyword PDF followed by a colon symbol (:) and the topic you are searching for.
>5. **Compare using “vs”** - By using the “vs” or “versus” between two words you want to compare, Google will provide an in-depth analysis of the two words, such as pointing out similarities and differences.
>6. **Use “DEFINE:" to search for the meaning of words - slang included** - The “DEFINE:” keyword provides a dictionary definition of a word. Also, you will be able to see etymology and a graph of its use over time.
>7. **Search images using images** - Using your mobile device's camera, you can search for images online by going to Google Images, activating your camera phone and taking a picture of the image you are searching for. Google will provide you with similar images on the web.
