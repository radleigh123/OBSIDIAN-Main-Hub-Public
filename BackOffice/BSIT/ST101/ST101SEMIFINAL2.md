### The Internet: Then and Now
The Internet started from the **Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Wide Area Network** which is called the **ARPANET**.

This was established by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s so that the military’s research unit could collaborate or partner with business and government laboratories. Afterwards, other universities and U.S. institutions were connected to ARPANET that resulted in the growth of ARPANET different from everyone’s expectations. ARPANET then attained the name of “[[ST101SEMIFINAL2#The Internet|Internet]].”

**Philippine Research Education and Government Information Network** (PREGINET)
is among the international peers reachable via **Trans-Eurasia Information Network** (TEIN), one of the Internet2’s peering relationships.

Just in August 2017, a national training course on nuclear neurology was held in which nationwide webcast among hospitals was made possible through the high-speed connectivity provided by PREGINET and the video conference server hosted locally at the **Department of Science and Technology-Advanced Science and Technology Institute** (DOST-ASTI).

### Internet Today: Still Growing
The number of internet users as of January 2018 is 4.021 billion which means that more than half of the world’s population is now online as revealed by We Are Social and Hootsuite in their 2018 Global Digital suite of reports.

As a result, the internet is open to anyone who can access it. If one can use a computer and if the computer is connected to the internet, he or she is free not only to use the resources posted by others, but also to create resources of his or her own; that is, the internet user can publish documents on the World Wide Web, exchange email messages with other users, and perform many other tasks.
