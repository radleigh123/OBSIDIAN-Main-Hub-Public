## Management of files
**File management** allows users to name, organize and arrange their files and folders in such a way that they are easy to find and distinguish.

In order to help you with this process, let’s take a look at some tips on effective file management:
- When installing new programs, use the default installation folders. This will ensure that all your programs are installed in the same folder.
- Save all your documents in the same root folder. This also applies to all music (music folder), pictures (images folder) and videos (videos folder).
- Create subfolders within the root folder in order to distinguish between documents.
- Name or rename your folders appropriately. When a folder is created, it will be named “New Folder”. Rename the folder according to the contents of it.
- File new documents as they are created. This will ensure that the document is in the correct folder and, therefore, can be found with more ease.
- Remove old documents and folders. Old documents and folders can take up space and cause your computer to become cluttered. In order to prevent this, you should delete documents and folders that are no longer needed. If you do not want to delete them, consider creating a root folder called “oldies” and moving all old documents to that folder.
- Make regular backups of important files. This will prevent you from losing any important information.

## Importing and Exporting

Importing and exporting can also be used to manage files and documents on your computer or smartphone.

## Operating System utilities
Most operating systems include various system utilities.
- Firewall
- File compressors
- File management utilities
- Update schedulers
- Backups

**File Compressors**
File-compression programs use advanced algorithms and mathematical formulas to decrease the amount of space used by files. But in reality, file compression is rarely used to free storage space. There are two important reasons for this:
1. Compressed files cannot be used immediately; they first need to be decompressed. Not only does this waste time every time you open up a file; it uses up the space you saved when you compressed the files in the first place.
2. The files most likely to use up your storage space are already compressed. This includes most video and music files. As such, compressing them further does not help.

**File Management Utilities**
provide users with a GUI that they can use to organize files and folders. ![[Pasted image 20221115172508.png|center]]

**Scheduling Utility**
The Scheduling Utility is located in the System ribbon menu. The new Scheduling feature provides savings in both time and human resources and greatly improves the efficiency with which you can automate repetitive and time consuming activities.
The three areas controlled by this utility are
- Report Scheduling
- Email Alerts
- Process Scheduling.

**Backup Utilities**
This program allows users to back up important files and folders, as well the important settings for the operating system.
>[!EXAMPLE|alt-co]- How to **Backup and Restore**:
>1. Purchase an external hard drive to use for the backup and connect it to your computer.
>2. Open the **Start** menu and type in “control panel”. This will open the **Control Panel**.
>3. Click **Backup and Restore** (in Windows 7) to open the **Backup and Restore** window.
>4. Click **Set up backup**.
>5. Select the external hard drive as the location where you would like to save the backup.
>6. If all your files are stored in your private folders (such as the Documents, Music and Videos folders), let Windows choose. Otherwise, select the folders that should be backed up manually.
>7. Click **Save and run the backup** option to create a backup of all your files.

**Defragmentation**
This process reorganizes your hard drive by taking all the pieces of data that are spread across your hard drive and reorganizing it so that the pieces are closer to each other.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Fragmentation</mark> occurs from files being constantly written, deleted and resized, and can lead to several problems. These include a slow computer, long boot-up times, random computer crashes and the computer freezing.
- **Optimise Drive Tool**, which comes with the Windows operating system and was previously known as Disk Defragmenter
- **PerfectDisk**
- **Norton Utilities**

**Spooling**
is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program or the system. Data is sent to and stored in memory or other volatile storage until the program or computer requests it for execution.

*Spool* is technically an acronym for simultaneous peripheral operations online.
