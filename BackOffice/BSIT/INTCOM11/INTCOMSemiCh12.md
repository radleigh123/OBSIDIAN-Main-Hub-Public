### Instant Messaging
Instant messaging has played a big role in shaping the way in which we communicate on a daily basis. This is because of the wide variety of uses that this method of communication offers.
>[!columns|no-t]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Advantages of Instant Messaging
>>-   Allows you to chat in “real time” to other people who also have an IM client
>>-   Messages are delivered immediately after being sent, if the person is online or is connected to the internet
>>-   One can see when your message has been read
>>-   It connects people regardless of where they are located
>>-   People can speak to multiple people in virtual conference/groups, share ideas and reach conclusions.
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Disadvantages of Instant Messaging
>>-   Because it is immediate, you have no time to reflect on the message you are sending, unlike an email where you can review the draft before sending it
>>-   Messages are not always saved
>>-   Instant messaging takes away the face to face, personal experience that people have when they are speaking to someone in person.

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
is a standard network protocol that is used to transfer files between a computer and the network server (usually over the internet). It does this by setting the rules for the way in which files can be uploaded and downloaded.
>[!columns|no-t]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Advantages of FTP
>>-   Easy to use (with the proper training)
>>-   Multiple file directories can be sent at the same time
>>-   File transfer progress is not lost if your connection fails
>>-   File transfers can be scheduled at times that are best suited to your needs
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Disadvantages of FTP
>>-   Data, username and password are shared in plain text, which makes it easy for hackers to access information
>>-   Requires training to use FTP effectively
>>-   It is difficult to monitor mishandled data and track the source of the problem
>>-   Not all FTP services encrypt your data, which makes it vulnerable to attack

>[!recite|no-i clean alt-co] Examples of VOIP Services
> While FTP was used quite commonly in the past, it is now used mainly in technical situations (for example, when uploading new files to a web server).
>-   **FileZilla Server:** This is an FTP server available to Windows users.

### Grid Computing & Cloud Computing
It is no longer sufficient, nor economical to use your own personal computer to analyze and store complex data.
-   **Grid computing**
	- is a computer model that has been connected to a network. It has the ability to process large volumes of data with the help of a group of networked computers that coordinate to solve a problem together.
-   **Cloud computing**
	- is the use of hardware or software on a server on the internet. It allows users to use software or save data without worrying about using up storage space.

>[!columns|no-t flex]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Advantages of Grid Computing
>>-   It can help you solve larger, much more complex problems in a much shorter time span
>>-   You do not have to buy more powerful hardware as you will make better use of existing hardware
>>-   If one computer fails, the other computers will take over the work, which makes the system very reliable
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Disadvantages of Grid Computing
>>-   Training is needed to make full use of grid computing
>>-   May require multiple people in order for the grid system to function
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Advantages of Cloud Computing
>>-   Since the cloud platform is managed and updated, it is much more reliable
>>-   It can be used from any device capable of connecting to the internet
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i ttl-c] Disadvantages of Cloud Computing
>>-   You may experience downtime if the cloud server is undergoing maintenance
>>-   Even though cloud computing uses security measures to protect your data, there is always a risk of files being compromised
>>-   You do not have full control over the platform as it is owned and managed by the service provider

>[!recite|no-i clean alt-co] Examples of Cloud and Grid Computing
> Both cloud and grid computing help the user to distribute computing over a large area.
>- **World Community Grid:**
>	- World Community Grid’s mission is to create the largest public computing grid benefiting humanity, which is funded and operated by IBM. Using the idle time of computers around the world, World Community Grid’s research projects have analysed aspects of the human genome, HIV, dengue, muscular dystrophy, and cancer.
>- **SKA (Square Kilometre Array):**
>	- The SKA is a worldwide network of radio telescopes that will consist of over one million squares metres of collecting area. This will generate an enormous amount of data will be processed by an enormous computing grid consisting of more than half a million computing cores (processors) distributed around the globe and linked by a powerful network.
>- Scientific research, helping scientists around the world to analyze and store massive amounts of data.
