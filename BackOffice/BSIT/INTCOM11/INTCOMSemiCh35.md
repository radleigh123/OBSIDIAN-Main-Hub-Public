## Factors that influence performance
Due to this, the computer is subject to some wear and tear, which can reduce its speed and performance.

**RAM**
- is responsible for temporarily storing the data that is being used by the computer’s processor.
- allows the processor to access the data much faster and easier than would be possible if the data was loaded from a secondary storage device (HDD)

>[!WARNING|alt-co] A slow computer can be an indication that you have <u>too little RAM</u>.

**Processor**
The CPU is the part of a computer that is responsible for receiving and carrying out a computer’s instructions.
There are two main factors that influence the speed of the CPU:
1. <mark class="hltr-blue">the GHz of the processor</mark>, which refers to the CPU frequency and is an indication of the processor speed. As a general guideline, the higher the frequency, the better the CPU.
2. <mark class="hltr-blue">the amount of cores</mark>. As with processor speed, more cores are generally better.

> More RAM allows more data to be stored in the RAM, which allows your programs to run faster.

**Applications**
Every computer has a limited number of resources (such as RAM and CPU processing time) that can be used to run applications. For <mark class="hltr-blue">each application currently running</mark>, the amount of <mark class="hltr-blue">available resources will become less</mark>.

**Caching**
Caching is a small, temporary form of storage that is created in a fast form of memory in order to allow data to be accessed more quickly.
Your computer uses the following three forms of caching:
- **CPU cache**
	- The difference in speed between a computer’s CPU and RAM has recently become too large. As a result, the RAM cannot provide all the information the CPU needs fast enough. To prevent this problem, many CPUs now have a small, high-speed cache built into the CPU, where it can temporarily store the data it needs.
- **Disk cache**
	- The disk cache is a small amount of RAM that is built into a hard-disk drive. It stores data that is being sent or received by the hard-disk plates for a short period of time.
- **Web cache**
	- The web cache is a small area on a computer’s hard drive where images and pages from the world-wide web are stored for a short period. This allows you to quickly load those images from your computer when you visit the page again, rather than to wait to have them load over a slow internet connection.

**Disk Optimization**
This will rearrange the areas where data is stored on the hard drive to make sure the pieces of a file are close to each other and that the fastest parts of the hard drive are used.

Another potential problem that you might encounter is running out of storage space. When this happens, you have the following options:
- Delete any files that you do not need any more.
- Use the Disk Clean-up application to help create some additional space.
- Buy an additional hard drive.

>[!FAQ|alt-co ttl-c collapse]- Something to know
> Computers are not limited to a single hard drive. If you are running low on storage space, do not hesitate to buy an additional hard drive to store more data.

**Malware**
In order to prevent malware from infecting your computer, or to remove any malware that might already be installed on your computer, you can use security applications, such as a firewall, antivirus and anti-spyware.

A **processor**, or “**microprocessor**,” is a small chip. Its basic job is to receive input and provide the appropriate output. Modern CPUs often include multiple processing cores, which work together to process instructions. While these “cores” are contained in one physical unit, they are actually individual processors.

Processors that include two cores are called **dual-core processors**, while those with four cores are called **quad-core processors**.
