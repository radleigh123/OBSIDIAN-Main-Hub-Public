## Gather data
Once you have determined your task requirements, you need to start looking at ways in which to gather the data and information needed to answer your main question.

**Interviews**
is a conversation between two people; the interviewer and the person being interviewed (interviewee).
Examples of interviews used to collect data include the following:
- One-on-one interviews conducted in person
- Interviews conducted over the phone
- Group interviews

**Questionnaires**
is a research method that uses a series of questions in order to gather data.
Examples of questionnaires used to collect data include the following:
- Surveys
- Opinion polls
- Multiple-choice tests

>[!NOTE]- Guidelines for prepping a questionnaire:
>- Decide what you are trying to learn from the questionnaire.
>- Identify potential questions that will help you get the information that you need.
>- Use closed questions (yes/no), as well as open questions (questions that require a description).
>- Keep your questions short and simple to avoid confusion.
>- Ask your questions in a way that will not guide people to a specific answer.
>- Keep your questionnaire as short as possible.
>- Test the questionnaire to ensure that it achieves what you are aiming for.

The data collected from questionnaires can be either quantitative or qualitative.

**Observation**
is a method of collecting data where the researcher observes and documents participants performing a task in their natural setting.
Examples of using observation to collect data include the following:
- Observing the interaction between a teacher and a student
- Observing a mechanic fixing a car

>[!FAQ|alt-co collapse ttl-c]- Something to know
> When using observation to collect data, do not disturb or interrupt the person, or process, you are observing. Interruptions might lead to inaccurate observations as it might cause deviations in the process.

Observation can be used to collect both quantitative and qualitative data.

**Documents & Records**
>[!aside|show-title]+ These documents consist:
>- databases
>- notes
>- reports
>- letters
>- records
>- written accounts

Written documents and records are one of the oldest methods used to capture data and present information.

**The Internet**
Using a search engine, such as Google, is much more time efficient and effective than visiting your local library.
Let’s take a look at the following examples of where the internet is being used to collect data:
- **Wikipedia**: This website contains a wide variety of data and information. (Information obtained from Wikipedia should always be checked for quality and accuracy.)
- **PriceCheck**: This website allows you to compare the cost of items from different retailers.
- **LinkedIn**: This website provides information on job vacancies, as well as the professional profiles of people looking for part-time and full-time employment.

>[!TIP]- Further Research
> Unfortunately, the information obtained from the data analysis is not sufficient to make any final conclusions. In order to obtain additional information, we used our own data as a guideline and did further research using secondary information sources, such as the internet and written media. When you use secondary information sources, always check the quality of the information to ensure that it is valid and accurate. You can ask a variety of questions to check the quality of information.
> Let’s take a look at some examples:
> -   **Questions focusing on facts:** These type of questions aim to gather as many facts as possible to ensure that the information is accurate:
> 	-   Who generated the information?
> 	-   Is there evidence to support the information?
> 	-   Is the information relevant and up to date?
> 	-   How many times has the information been used?
> 	-   Does the information cover your topic?
> 	-   Is the information biased toward a specific outcome?
> 		-   **Questions focusing on exploring the information:** These questions aim to help you get a better understanding of the information:
> 	-   What does the information indicate?
> 	-   Why does the information indicate this?
> 	-   How did the information come to its conclusion?
> 		- **Questions focusing on predicting the outcome of the information:** These questions help you use the information to predict a possible outcome, or come up with a hypothesis:
> 	- Will I be able to use this information to find a solution to my problem?
> 
> The internet contains a wealth of information that has been uploaded by many different people; however, not all the information is accurate. This is because some people do not do proper research to ensure that the information that they put on the internet is accurate. There are also some that attempt to mislead you on purpose. Due to this, it is especially important to ensure that information obtained from the internet is accurate. Check the website that you are using to make sure it contains accurate and relevant information from a reliable and trusted source. You can do this in the following way:
> -   Make sure the website is easy to navigate.
> -   Determine for whom the website is intended.
> -   Check that the website and its information are up to date.
> -   Look at who supports the website.
> -   Check the credentials of the author of the information you are looking at.
> -   Check that the links on the website are working. This is especially important when checking references.
> -   Make sure that the information on the website is similar to that obtained from other websites.
