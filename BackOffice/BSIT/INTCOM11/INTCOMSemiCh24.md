With the invention and popularization of the internet, the world is more connected than ever before. This connectivity has led to the creation of new technologies that have eliminated the problem of distance that we once faced.

### Communication
In the old days, we were limited to using landline phones to make calls and writing physical letters when communicating over a long distance. Fortunately, that is no longer needed. Email, VoIP, video conferencing and smartphones have made communication much faster, cheaper and easier than ever before.
### Conducting Business
The internet has created a whole new platform that we can use to conduct business and to reach new customers. This includes the following:
-   Creating online advertisements for products in order to reach more customers
-   Creating and hosting online services, for example Netflix and Amazon
-   Creating completely new business ideas, for example YouTube and Esports
### Meeting new people
