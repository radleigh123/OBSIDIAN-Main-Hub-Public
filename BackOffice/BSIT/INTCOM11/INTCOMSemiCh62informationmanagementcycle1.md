## Task requirements
In order to determine whether or not e-learning can be implemented in South African schools, you need to understand exactly what is expected of you. To do this, you will need to write down the task requirements by looking at the instructions given in your PAT assignment. You can do this in the following way:
1. **Identify the main problem you have to solve**: Start by writing down everything you know about the problem and determine the main question that you would like to answer.
2. **Identify a possible solution**: Determine what information you will need in order to answer your main question. This usually requires creating questions with answers that will let you solve your main problem.
