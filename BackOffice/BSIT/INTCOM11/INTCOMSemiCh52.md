>- **Addiction**: The immersive feeling of virtual reality might cause some users to turn their back on the real world.
>- **Cybersickness**: This is a form of motion sickness that is caused due to using virtual reality technology.
>- **Physical injuries**: Prolonged use of virtual reality can lead to eye strain and muscle fatigue.
>- Virtual reality devices can be used for a variety of things; including training simulations and games.
