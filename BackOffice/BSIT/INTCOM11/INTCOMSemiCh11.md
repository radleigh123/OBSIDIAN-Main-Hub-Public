The **Internet** is one of the largest, most powerful and entertaining inventions ever made by humans.
> It has brought us a wealth of information, it has enabled us to conduct business from our homes, it connects millions of people and it provides an endless source of entertainment.

>[!aside|show-title]+ Local Area Network (LAN)
> is a computer network that **covers a small area**, such as a house or office, and that the computers in the network share resources, such as internet connections, printers and server connections.
>> The network is usually **limited** to a certain number of computers (**between two and 25**), but there is no absolute limit.

### Wide-Area Networks (WAN)
is a network that **covers a large** geographical **area**, such as a neighborhood, a city, a country, or even the world, **connects two or more LANs**.
### Equipment needed to connect to a Network
1. A **network adapter**
	- is a piece of hardware that can be added to a computer and makes it possible to connect to a network.
2. **Network cables**
	- are used to connect a computer to a LAN, or to connect one network to another network.
3. **Hubs**, **Switches**, or **Routers**
	- are devices that allow multiple computers to connect to the same network. They can also be used to connect two networks to each other.

### The Internet as an example of a [[INTCOMSemiCh11#Wide-Area Networks (WAN)|WAN]]
The internet is a computer network that consists of billions of connected devices, allowing people to share information, obtain entertainment, or chat to one another.
### How does the Internet work?
The internet is a global network of networks. It is made up of many different networks, in different countries around the world that are all connected together into one huge WAN.

The information is transferred between computers using protocols. A **protocol** is a set of rules for the transmission of data between devices. Let’s take a look at some of the following common protocols:

- **Hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP):**
	- An Internet-based protocol for sending and receiving web pages
-   **HTTP secure (HTTPS):**
	- Secure HTTP protocol; used mainly for e-commerce
-   **Internet message access protocol (IMAP):**
	- Used for email messages on the internet
-   **Post office protocol version 3 (POP3):**
	- Used by email clients to retrieve messages from remote servers
-   **Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP):**
	- Used for email messages on the internet
-   **Email client protocol:**
	- is a standard method of exchanging information between email clients like Thunderbird or Apple Mail and email provider’s servers like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and vice versa
-   **Voice over internet protocol (VoIP):**
