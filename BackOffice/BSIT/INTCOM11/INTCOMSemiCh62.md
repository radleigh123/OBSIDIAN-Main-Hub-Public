## Information Management
Information management is the process of collecting, processing, and presenting data and information.
The process consists of the following three main steps:
1. **Input**: This is the first step of the information management process and consists of identifying the main problems and collecting data.
2. **Process and analyze**: Once all the data has been gathered, it is converted to information by processing and analyzing the data.
3. **Output**: This is the final step in the process and consists of presenting the information in such a way that it can be easily understood by other people.

To recap, the five main steps of the information-processing cycle include:
1. **Input:** The first step in the information-processing cycle is when the computer receives data from the user. The data can be either in the form of information or instructions.
2. **Storage:** The input data is then stored by the computer. This can be either permanently on a hard drive, or temporarily in the RAM (the computers short-term memory).
3. **Processing:** Once the data is stored, the computer can start manipulating the data. This is done according to instructions programmed into the computer.
4. **Output:** The manipulated data can now be sent to an output device. This includes a screen that can display the data as well as other devices, such as a printer.
5. **Communication:** The final step of the information-processing cycle is communication of the information to other sources. This can be done between two computers, or over a massive network, such as the internet.
