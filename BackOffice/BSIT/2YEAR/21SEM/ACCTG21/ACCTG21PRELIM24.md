## Liabilities
Liabilities represent <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">what your business owes</mark>. These are expenses you have incurred but have not yet paid.
> E.g., let’s say you needed machinery serviced or repaired. It was a fairly pricey fix, so the repair company just gave you an **invoice**. You haven’t yet paid for the service, but you owe it. That’s a **liability**.

Types of business accounts that fall under the liability branch include:
- Payroll Tax Liabilities
- Sales Tax Collected
- Credit Memo Liability
- Notes Payable
- Accounts Payable
>[!FAQ|no-i collapse] Accounts payable (AP) are considered liabilities and not expenses.
> Because AP are <u>expenses you have incurred</u> but <u>not yet paid</u> for. As a result, you add a liability, or debt.

<br>

>[!EXAMPLE|t-w table-clean]
> You buy $500 of inventory on credit. This increases your Accounts Payable account (credit). And, it increases the amount of inventory you have (debit). Your journal entry might look something like this:
> 
> | <center>Account</center>   | <center>Debit</center> | <center>Credit</center> |
> | ------------------ | ----- | ------ |
> | Inventory               | 500   |            |
> | Accounts Payable |           | 500    |
