**Worked Examples - Credits and Debits**
1. The owner of a car wash provides their company with a $1,000 initial investment. Is the entry to the companyâ€™s cash account a debit or a credit?
    - **Debit**
        - Explanation: The $1000 investment causes cash toÂ **increase**Â and cash is anÂ **asset**Â (a normal debit account), so the entry is aÂ **debit**.
2. The owner of a car wash provides their company with a $1,000 initial investment. Is the entry to the companyâ€™s ownerâ€™s equity account a debit or a credit?
    - **Credit**
        - Explanation 1 (DEALER): The $1000 investment causes ownerâ€™s equity toÂ **increase**Â and ownerâ€™s equity is anÂ **equity**Â account (a normal credit account), so the entry is aÂ **credit**.
        - Explanation 2 (principle of double-entry bookkeeping): Since there are two equal and opposite sides to every financial transaction, we know that since cash was debited we need to credit the other side of the transaction to keep everything balanced.
3. The car wash pays a supplier $200 in cash, which account is debited? Accounts Payable or Cash?
    - **Accounts Payable**
        - Explanation: A payment from the cash account causes cash toÂ **decrease**Â and cash is anÂ **asset**Â (a normal debit account), so the cash entry is aÂ **credit**. This payment would alsoÂ **decrease**Â Accounts Payable which is aÂ **liability**Â (a normal credit account), so the accounts payble entry is aÂ **debit**.
4. A customer gets their car washed for $10. They pay on account with 30 day credit terms. Which account is credited? Revenue, cash or accounts receivable?
    - **Revenue**
        - Explanation: A customer paying on credit causes Accounts Receivable toÂ **increase**. Accounts Receivable is an Asset account (a normal debit account), so the accounts receivable entry is aÂ **debit**. Revenue isÂ **increased**Â as well. Since Revenue is aÂ **credit**Â account and it increases, it isÂ **credited**, and this is the answer. Cash is not impacted.
5. The following month, the car wash receives $10 from the customer. Which account is credited? Revenue, cash or accounts receivable?
    - **Accounts Receivable**
        - Explanation: Receiving $10 causes cash toÂ **increase**Â and accounts receivable toÂ **decrease**. Cash is anÂ **asset**Â (normal debit account), so cash is debited. Accounts receivable is anÂ **asset**Â (normal debit account) as well, so since itÂ **decreases**, it isÂ **credited**. Revenue is not impacted.
