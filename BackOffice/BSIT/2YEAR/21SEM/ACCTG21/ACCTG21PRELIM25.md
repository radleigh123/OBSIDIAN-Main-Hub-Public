## Equity
Equity is the difference between your assets and liabilities. It shows you <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">how much your business is worth</mark>.
> Your company’s Equity accounts will increase when there is an investment or funding into your business and decrease when there is a loss or an owner’s draw occurs.

Here are some common accounts for Equity accounts:
- Owner’s Equity
- Common Stock
- Retained Earnings
