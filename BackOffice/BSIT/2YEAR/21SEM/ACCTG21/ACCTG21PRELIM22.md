## Expenses
Expenses are costs your business incurs during operations. Your company’s expenses are anything you purchase to run your business. When you buy fuel for your company vehicle or stock up on office supplies, those purchases are considered company expenses and you need accounts involved in that.
> E.g., office supplies are considered **expenses**.

Here are some common sub-accounts for Expense accounts:
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Insurance Expenses
- Vehicle Expenses (Account)
	- Mileage (*sub-account*)
	- Repairs and maintenance (*sub-account*)
- Payroll Expenses or salary accounts
- Salary Expenses
- Rent
- Office Expenses

> Let’s say you spend $1,000 on rent. You pay for the expense with your Checking account. Increase your Rent Expense account with a debit and credit your Checking account.
