### Major Perspectives in Understanding Society and Culture
**Symbolic Interactionism**
is a micro-level theory that focuses on meanings attached to human interaction, both verbal and non-verbal, and to symbols.
> In simple terms, *people in society understand their social worlds through communication — the exchange of meaning through language and symbols.*

### Relationship between Science & Technology with Society
**Technological [[somnambulism|Somnambulism]]**
>[!QUOTE|author mark collapse] Landon Winner
> “*the puzzle of our time is that we so willingly sleepwalk through the process of reconstituting the conditions of human existence*”.

The major problems he presents with this sleepwalking are:
- We don’t think through the affects technology has on us.
- Vast changes in the structure of our common world due to technology are  undertaken with little attention to what they mean.
- We only pay attention to whether or not the new technology provides a convenient or efficient service or turns a profit.
- Technology’s broader significance only show up later as surprising “side effects” or “secondary” consequences.

**Technological Determinism**
> is  the idea that <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">technology shapes social change</mark>. It determines our future.

believes that advancements of in technology are the moments that bring each new phase in human history. E.g., the invention of the wheel revolutionized human mobility, allowing humans to travel greater distances and carry greater load with them. Thus, a technological advancement changed the course of human history for all time.

**Social Construction of Technology** (**SCOT**)
it views the development of technology as an interactive process of discourse among technologists or engineers and relevant (or interested) social groups.
