## Logic Gates
A logic gate is a device that acts as a <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">building block for digital circuits</mark>. They perform basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital circuits. Most electronic devices we use today will have some form of logic gates in them. For example, logic gates can be used in technologies such as smartphones, tablets or within memory devices.

In a circuit, logic gates will make decisions based on a combination of digital signals coming from its inputs. Most logic gates have two inputs and one output. Logic gates are based on Boolean algebra. At any given moment, every terminal is in one of the two binary conditions, `false` or `true`. False represents `0`, and true represents `1`. Depending on the type of logic gate being used and the combination of inputs, the binary output will differ. A logic gate can be thought of like a light switch, wherein one position the output is off -- `0`, and in another, it is on -- `1`. Logic gates are commonly used in **integrated circuits** (**IC**).
