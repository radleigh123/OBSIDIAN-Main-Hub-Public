> Technical writers must know who the members of their audience are and what those readers need or want to know.

Technical writing is written for both internal and external audiences.

Technical writing, the writer is transparent. He is like a member of a stage crew, a behind-the-scenes operator, whose primary obligation is to satisfy the audience’s need for information. NOTE: <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Good writers produce work without drawing attention to their role.</mark>

A writer may write a poem or short story without the intention of sharing it with anyone, however, <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">technical writing implies an audience, often a very specific audience, but sometimes a more varied audience.</mark>

>[!NOTE]
> Your relationship to your readers determines how you write your document—to the tone you use, the formality of the language, and its medium.

### Types of Audiences
**Lay Reader**
a general reader without expert knowledge but with an interest in a subject.

**Technician**
a person with skilled knowledge in an area who implements the idea or plans of the expert.

**Expert**
an authority in a particular field who is highly skilled and professional, perhaps with an advanced degree.

**Manager**
a person who organizes personnel and is responsible for the day-to-day operations as well as long-range planning.

> **NOTE**: A reader can fall into more than one category. Thinking through the categories will help you make decisions about how best to communicate with your audience.

**Target Audience**
which the message is written, the audience to which the writer is writing by using language this reader will understand.

a single person or a group whose point of view is the same

**Multiple audience**
readers whose points of view differ.

**Demographics**
information such as the age, sex, income, and educational level of your group.

> **NOTE:** As a writer, your relationship with your readers is also important. The needs and wants of your audience dictate every decision you make as a writer.

### Analyze your Target Audience
**Knowledge Level**
what people know and how well they know it varies widely from one person to the next.
> E.g., the child suffered from contusions and lacerations.

- Experience, age, expertise can affect how much someone knows.
>[!NOTE|clean no-t collapse]
>- What does my reader already know about the topic?
>- Is my reader an expert, a technician, or a lay reader?
>- What does my reader need to know?
>- What does my reader want to know?

**Role**
the area of responsibility before writing, this is the function or job that someone
performs at work.
> E.g., if you write a memo to the accounting office about a planned purchase, you should accommodate the accountant’s role by including information about the cost.

- Job title affects not only knowledge level, but also the information your reader thinks is important
>[!NOTE|clean no-t collapse]
>- How strong is my reader’s interest in my topic?
>- Are my reader’s priorities different form mine or the same as mine?
>- Is my reader likely to agree with my point of view?

**Interest**
when your readers are interested in your subject, they read with greater enthusiasm. Where you find common interest, take advantage of it.
- Interest can be affected by age, experience, cultural background, and role.

> **NOTE:** Accept those readers’ lack of interest and focus (TBD PUTOL)


**Cultural Background**
this is the special beliefs, customs, and values specific to particular group of people or to a particular region.
