**Technical Communication**
is communication done in the workplace. The message usually involves a technical subject with a specific purpose and audience.

**Technical Writing**
is writing done in the workplace, although the workplace may be an office, a construction site, or a kitchen table. The subject is usually technical, written carefully for a specific audience.
>[!INFO] Technical Writing is Essential in the Workplace for some reasons:
>- It allows readers to read and study at their convenience
>- Easily pass along information to others
>- Keep a permanent record for future reference

>> NOTE: conservative estimate suggest that you will spend at least 20% of your time writing in a technical or business occupation. Professionals in engineering and technology careers spend as much as 40% of their time writing (Anderson, Paul. Technical Communication: A Reader Centered Approach).

### Characteristics of Technical Writing

>>[!INFO|clean no-t] 
>>**Expository Writing**

**Technical Research** – written to fulfill the need, it is technical and factual, may require library research, scientific observation.
> In technical writing, often the need is to share information or to have someone perform an action.

#### Audience
- the technical writer expects more from a very specific reader
- the technical writer not only expects the reader to understand the writing, but also wants the reader to do something after reading.

> In technical writing, the needs of the reader dictate every decision the writer makes.

#### Organization
the personal essay or research paper make standard use of a topic sentence and transitional expressions, but you still need to read far into each document before the main point and the organization become apparent.
- headings help readers perceive the organization at a single glance
- headings give you opportunity to read only what you want or need to read

#### Style
gives the audience an idea of the type of document they are reading
- **Personal Essays** – casual, almost conversational, and predictable; the writer uses examples and description.
- **Research Paper** - formal and more distant than the personal essay, with a thesis to clarify the purpose of the paper and documentation to enhance credibility.

> technical document uses a simple, concise, straightforward style that is easily understood.

>[!INFO|ttl-c collapse no-i txt-c] **Jargon**
> the highly specialized language of a particular discipline or technical field.

#### Tone
refers to emotional overtones—the way the words make a person feel. It describes the emotional character of a document.
- **Personal Essay** – casual, dejected, and agonized.
- **Research Paper** – generally objective or businesslike

> Readers in technical documents read for information, not for entertainment. They read to learn something or to take action.

>[!DONE|no-i collapse ttl-c] NOTE
> Technical writing differs from academic writing in its presentation, approach to subject matter, and audience and from imaginative writing in its “*one-meaning-and-one-meaning-only*” presentation.
