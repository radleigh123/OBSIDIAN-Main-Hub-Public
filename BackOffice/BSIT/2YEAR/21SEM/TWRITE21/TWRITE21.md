<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Communication</mark> at its core, the aim of communication is to transmit information from one person to another so that the **sender** and **receiver** understand the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">message</mark> in the same way. The responsibility for clear communication usually falls on the sender. But the receiver is also responsible to confirm a clear understanding of the message. *Communication is a dynamic and cyclical process*.
