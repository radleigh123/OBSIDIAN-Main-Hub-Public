>>[!NOTE|clean no-t]
>>- **Sender**: This is the person that is delivering a message to a recipient.
>>- **Message**: This refers to the information that the sender is relaying to the receiver.
>>- **Channel of communication**: This is the transmission or method of delivering the message.
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-t]
>>- **Decoding**: This is the interpretation of the message. Decoding is performed by the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">receiver</mark>.
>>- **Receiver**: The receiver is the person who is getting or receiving the message.
>>- **Feedback**: In some instances, the receiver might have feedback or a response for the sender. This starts an interaction.

**Steps of the communication process**
1. **Idea formation** - The communication process begins when the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">sender has an idea</mark> to be communicated.  The idea will be influenced by complex factors surrounding the sender.  The sender must begin by clarifying the idea and purpose.
2. **Message encoding** - The idea must be encoded into words, symbols, and gestures that will convey meaning.  Because no two people interpret information in the exact same way, the sender must be careful to choose words, symbols and gestures that are commonly understood to reduce the chances of misunderstanding.  Therefore, a <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">sender must be aware of the receiver’s communication skills</mark> and etc. to ensure clear communication.
3. **Message transmission** - Messages can be transmitted in a <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">verbal</mark>, <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">written</mark>, or <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">visual manner</mark>.  For clear communication to occur, the medium and message must match.

4. **Decoding** - When the message reaches the receiver, the message must be <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">decoded into its intended meaning</mark>. Successful decoding is more likely when the receiver creates a receptive environment and ignores distractions. Alert receivers strive to understand both verbal and nonverbal cues, avoid prejudging the message, and expect to learn from the communication.
5. **Feedback** - feedback occurs the sender and receiver <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">check to ensure the message was understood</mark> as intended.  Feedback is a shared responsibility between the sender and the receiver and can be verbal or non-verbal.
