# Sculpture in the Philippines

## Sculptures
> is considered one of the oldest art forms.

>[!timeline|t-l ngm c-purple]+ 
> In the Philippines, sculpting is an indigenous art embedded in our local cultures.
>> Various carved art forms are part of ethnolinguistic groups’ daily lives and traditions, such as: 
>> - [O]  the anito and bulul of the groups in the Cordillera
>> - [A]  the okir and pako-rabong designs seen on the sarimanok, naga
>> - [O]  panolong of those in Mindanao.

> In the Christianized communities, pre-colonial idols were replaced with the images of Christ, the Virgin, and the Santos during the Spanish period. Consequently, from the 19th century onwards, the number of local craftsmen and woodcarvers, both Chinese and Filipino, increased, especially in Quiapo and Santa Cruz districts in Manila and Paete, Laguna.

>[!timeline|t-l ngm c-orange]+ 
> Towards the end of the 19th century, secular art emerged. Sculptors began to work on portraits and later classical sculptures through the Academia de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado de Manila. After the Second World War, modern sculpture emerged and introduced a wide array of media and materials. These new artistic resources and techniques gave way to what we now know as a contemporary sculpture.

- **Isabelo Tampinco**
	- Tampinco’s exceptional masterpieces at the Old Senate Session Hall make up an entablature of relief sculptures of great lawmakers, moralists, and philosophers in history from Biblical times to the 20th century. The artist created these figures with the help of his sons, Angel and Vidal, who inherited their father’s artistry and skills.
- **Guillermo E. Tolentino | Lualhati | Undated | Marble on granite pedestal**
	- Lualhati is a marble portrait of Guillermo Tolentino’s daughter when she was six years old. Lualhati, who now resides in Germany, is among Tolentino’s seven children with his wife, Paz Raymundo. This is the only sculpture of the artist’s family member in the National Fine Arts Collection.
- **Arturo Rogerio Luz | Harana in Manila | 1955 | Engraved in Steuben crystal**

- **Abdulmari Asia Imao | Sarimanok | 1996 | Brass**
	- The Sarimanok is an ornate chicken-like figure or a decorative bird notable in Maranao art. It represents a messenger of _datus_ or chieftains and a symbol of royalty in the Maranao epic called “Darangen.”
- **Julie Lluch | Doxology | 1993 | Terracotta**
	- Doxology is composed of two life-size figures. One is the artist’s self-portrait resting on the floor, which seems to be in a deep sleep with hands clutched together, representing the artist’s painful experiences and sufferings.  At the same time, the other figure has both hands and arms extended with eyes gazing towards the heavens in the act of prayer.

It has adornment with hanging glass elements inspired by the colorful wrappers of pastillas (local milk candies) and mirrors and shaped glass depicting waves and bubbles representing the Philippines as an archipelago.
- **Agnes Arellano | Eshu | 1997 | Cold-cast marble and volcanic cinder**
	- Eshu, in African traditions, most especially with the Nigerian belief, is the Lord of the Crossroads or God of Fate. This sculptural work in volcanic cinder and cold-cast marble is a fantasy self-portrait cast and directly modeled by the artist.
