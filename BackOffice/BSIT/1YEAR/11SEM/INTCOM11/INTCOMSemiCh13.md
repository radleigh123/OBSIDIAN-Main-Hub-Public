## Internet Connections
Throughout this chapter, we have looked at some of the wonderful services that you can access through the internet. However, in order to access these services, you need an internet connection.
### Broadband
- is a high data-rate connection that allows the user to send data over multiple channels.
- It is important to note that not all broadband connections are available in all areas. When you decide on getting either a wired or a wireless connection, you should consider the coverage and availability of the various connections in your area.
### What type of Internet Connection do you need?
When choosing an internet connection, you need to consider the following four factors:
1. Speed of the Internet
2. Data cap of your connection
3. Cost of the Internet
4. Equipment you will need to connect to the Internet
#### Internet Speed of Bandwidth
refers to the amount of data that can be transferred over a network in a specific time. <mark class="hltr-blue">Higher the bandwidth</mark> the <mark class="hltr-blue">more data can be transferred</mark> in less the time.

**Downloading** refers to the transfer of data from the internet to your computer. When choosing an internet connection one needs to look at the following:
-   Speed of the internet connection
-   Type of connection one can afford

#### Data Caps & Bundles
A **data cap** (*bandwidth cap*) is a service provider-imposed limit on the amount of data transferred by a user account at a specified level of through put over a given time period, for a specified fee.

A **data bundle** gives access to the internet. To surf we use internet data which is measured in bytes – with data bundles it doesn’t matter how many minutes you stay connected, but rather how many bytes you use. It’s a cheaper yet a convenient way to connect to the internet.
#### Fair-usage Policy
A **fair-usage policy** (*FUP*, also called a *reasonable-usage policy, or an acceptable-usage policy*) is a data limit placed on “uncapped” internet accounts. According to this policy, your internet account will not be capped or limited unless you use too much data, in which case your internet access may be slowed (throttled) to the point where it is unusable.
#### Internet Costs
In general, a fast internet connection with a large data cap will be more expensive than a slow internet connection with a low data cap.
#### Equipment Needed
The final thing to consider is what equipment you will need in order to connect to the internet. This includes four basic components:
1. Computer
2. Internet Connection Channel
3. Internet Communication device
4. ISP
### Throttling
**Bandwidth throttling** is a purposeful slowing of available bandwidth. In other words, and in general, it’s an _intentional_ lowering of the “speed” that’s typically available over an internet connection.
#### Why would anyone want to throttle bandwidth
Very simply, bandwidth throttling means <mark class="hltr-blue">limiting how fast you can access</mark> something when online. 

For example, an ISP might throttle bandwidth during certain times of the day to decrease congestion over their network, which lowers the amount of data they have to process at once, saving them the need to buy more and faster equipment to handle internet traffic at that level.
#### Shaping
Traffic shaping is used for a number of purposes:
-   Time-sensitive data may be given priority over traffic that can be delayed briefly with little-to-no ill effect.
-   A large ISP (Internet service provider) may shape the traffic of an independent reseller.
-   In a corporate environment, business-related traffic may be given priority over other traffic.
-   An ISP may limit bandwidth consumption for certain applications to reduce costs and create the capacity to take on additional subscribers. This practice can effectively limit a subscriber’s “unlimited connection” and is often imposed without notification.
-   Traffic shaping could be an integral component of the proposed two-tiered Internet, in which certain customers or services would get traffic priority for a premium charge.
