## The role of the Operating System
>[!aside|show-title collapse]+ OS
> is a group of system software that is responsible for controlling a computer’s hardware and software, providing a user interface with which to interact and manage the computer’s resources.

These categories consist the following:

### Starting the computer
In computing, **booting** is the process of starting a computer.
1. After it is switched on, a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) has no software in its main memory.
2. some process must load software consists of picture-like items (icons and arrows for example), GUI.
	- [I] The main pieces of a GUI:
		- pointer
		- icons
		- windows
		- menus
		- scroll bars
		- an intuitive input device
	- [F] Some common GUIs:
		- Microsoft Windows
		- Mac OSX
		- Chrome OS
		- GNOME
		- KDE
		- Android

### Providing a user interface

Most modern computers, laptops and smartphones use a graphical user interface (GUI), which allows the user to interact with programs using point-and-click technology.

- Icons
- Program windows
- Menus
- Tabs on your browser
- Buttons

### Managing programs
One of the most important tasks of the operating system is to help the computer manage hundreds of processes that run at the same time.

An example of this can be seen when listening to music while you are playing games. You want your <mark class="hltr-blue">operating system to allocate the exact number of resources to each of the applications</mark>, allowing them to run at the same time.
#### Single vs Multiple Users

>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Single-user OS
>> are normally designed for home and private use, as these computers use software that is licensed for a single user only.
>>- **Microsoft Windows**
>>- **MacOS**

>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Multiple-user OS
>> allow more than one user to access and use the computer system at the same time.
>>- **Unix**
>>- **Linux**

>[!FAQ|alt-co ttl-c]- Something to know
> A single-user operating system will allow you to create multiple user profiles. However, it will still be limited to only one active user.

#### Multitasking
Multitasking operating systems allow the computer to run multiple processes (tasks), or applications at the same time.
>[!FAQ|alt-co ttl-c]- Something to know
> When using a multiple-user operating system, it is important to make sure that you balance the requirements of each user so that the resources of the main computer are shared among the users.

#### Task Manager (Windows)
- allows the user to see which tasks and applications are currently running on the computer, and how much memory and CPU processing power is being dedicated to each individual task.
- It also allows the user to forcefully end any applications that might have stopped working, or are using too many resources.

>[!FAQ|alt-co ttl-c]- Something to know
> One of the reasons why your smartphone’s battery goes flat, even when the screen is turned off and you are not using it, is that your CPU is still running tasks.
> This includes checking for updates, looking for and downloading messages and emails, and making sure you are connected to an internet-enabled network.
