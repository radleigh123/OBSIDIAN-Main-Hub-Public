## Processing data
In order to convert your gathered data into usable information, you need to _**analyse**_ the data. This can be done by sorting and grouping the data in a way that is easy to understand.
>[!FAQ|alt-co ttl-c]- Something to know
> The method used to sort your data depends on the type of data.
>- For example, numerical data (numbers) can be sorted from lowest to highest, while string data (words) can be sorted alphabetically.

Let’s take a look at some of the tools that you can use to analyse your data:
- Mathematical operators: Excel and databases use standard mathematical signs, such as a plus (+), minus (-), multiplication (*) and division (/).
- Formulae: A data analysis can be performed using the following formulae:
	- ¿ SUM: This function calculates the total of a range of numbers.
	- ¿ AVERAGE: This function calculates the average of a range of numbers.
	- ¿ MIN: This function returns the minimum value from a list of values.
	- ¿ MAX: This function returns the maximum value from a list of values.
	- ¿ COUNT: This function counts the numbers in a list of values.
	- ¿ VLOOKUP: This function allows you to search for a value in the left-most column of a spreadsheet. If found, it returns a value.
	- ¿ IF statements: This function allows you to output text if a case is valid or false. For example, the formula IF(A1<A2, “Yes”, “No”) will give an answer of “Yes” when A1 is smaller than A2 and an answer of “No” when A1 is bigger than A2.

Database programs, such as Microsoft Access, use queries instead of formulae in order to analyse data. Queries do exactly the same things as the functions and formulae in Excel, but with less manual work.
