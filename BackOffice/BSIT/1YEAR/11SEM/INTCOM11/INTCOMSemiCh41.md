## Electronic Communication
This includes calls, messages, group chats, emails, social networks and websites. These methods of electronic communication have made our lives much easier and enabled us to communicate with people around the world.
>[!column|flex no-t]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Pros
>>- **Speedy transmission**: It requires only a few seconds to communicate through electronic media because it supports quick transmission.
>>- **Wide coverage**: The world has become a global village and communication around the globe requires only a second.
>>- **Low cost**: Electronic communication saves time and money. For example, text SMS is cheaper than the traditional letter.
>>- **Exchange of feedback**: Electronic communication allows the instant exchange of feedback. So communication becomes perfect using electronic media.
>>- **Managing global operation**: Due to the advancement of electronic media, business managers can easily control operation across the globe. Video or teleconferencing e-mail and mobile communication are helping managers in this regard.
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Cons
>>- **The volume of data**: The volume of telecommunication information is increasing at such a fast rate that business people are unable to absorb it within the relevant time limit.
>>- **The cost of development**: Electronic communication requires huge investment for infrastructural development. Frequent change in technology also demands further investment.
>>- **Legal status**: Data or information, if faxed, may be distorted and will cause zero value in the eye of law.
>>- **Undelivered data**: Data may not be retrieved due to system error or fault with the technology. Hence required service will be delayed.
>>- **Dependency**: Technology is changing every day and therefore poor countries face the problem as they cannot afford the new or advanced technology. Therefore poor countries need to be dependent towards developed countries for sharing global network.

#### Electronic communication best practices
When you communicate on the internet – whether it is via email, instant messaging, or posting a blog – it is important that you follow proper **netiquette**.

#### Types of Electronic Communication
**Email**
is one of the first and most popular forms of electronic communication.
It allows the user to send and receive files and messages over the internet, and can be used on a wide variety of devices.
>[!column|flex no-t]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Pros
>>- Email is a free tool.
>>- Email is quick.
>>- Email is simple. It is easy to use, email allows for the easy and quick access of information and contacts.
>>- Email allows for easy referencing. Messages that have been sent and received can stored, and searched through safely and easily.
>>- Email is accessible from anywhere – as long as you have an internet connection.
>>- Email is paperless, and therefore, beneficial for the planet.
>>- Email allows for mass sending of messages, you can send one particular message to several recipients all at once.
>>- Email allows for instant access of information and files.
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Cons
>>- Email could potentially cause information overload. Some messages may be dismissed or left unread, especially if there are a lot coming in and the network has not integrated some sort of email alert system into the computers at work.
>>- Email lacks a personal touch.
>>- Email can be disruptive. Going through each email can be disruptive to work as it does require a bit of time. This disruption is decreased through the utilisation of an email alert system.
>>- Email cannot be ignored for a long time.
>>- Emails can cause misunderstandings. Because email does not include nonverbal communication, recipients may misinterpret the sender’s message. This is particularly true of senders fail to go through their messages before they send them.
>>- Email messages can contain viruses. It’s best to be aware of this possibility so that you are careful when opening messages from people you don’t know, or when downloading attachments.
>>- Email should be kept short and brief. This is especially difficult if you are one to send messages that are too long.
>>- Email requires timely responses. While some people tend to disregard messages, those that require responses should be replied to as soon as they are received and read. If not, urgent and important messages may be left untended.

>[!NOTE|alt-co]+ When communicating by email, always note the following:
>- Be polite.
>- Do not write emails that are unnecessarily long.
>- Do not spam people with emails that they are not interested in.
>- Make sure that your message is logical and says what you intended to say.

>[!FAQ|alt-co collapse]- Something to know
> **Asynchronous communication** means that a message can be sent without the message receiver being available at the time. 
> Most messaging applications are asynchronous. Most phone call applications, however, are synchronous.
##### ...some additional features
Email is not limited to only sending messages over the internet; it provides users with many features.
- **Calendar**
	- **Google Calendar** is a time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google.
- **Contact List**
	- You can now get to the contacts page by clicking the Apps icon in the upper right corner of the Gmail inbox.
- **Tasks**
	- Gmail integrates a simple to-do list into your account. Google Tasks allows you to create lists of items, set due dates, and add notes. You can even create tasks directly from Gmail messages.
- **Archives**
	- These messages remain in your Gmail account and can be retrieved easily at a later time, but in the meantime, they are out of sight and out of mind.

#### Instant Messaging
refers to short messages that are sent in real time over the internet. The messages can include multimedia items, such as pictures, videos and voice recordings.
>[!column|flex no-t]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Pros
>>- Messages are free to send
>>- Messages are received directly after being sent
>>- You can see if the message has been delivered
>>- You can see when your message has been read
>>- You can send a variety of messages; including text messages, pictures, videos, music and web links
>>- You can create group conversations in order to discuss a specific topic or plan events
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Cons
>>- Messages are not always saved
>>- It is an informal method of communication and might not be suited for business-related communications
>>- There is a pressure to respond immediately as people can see when you read their messages
>>- Can be distracting as one message can lead to a whole conversation
>>- Low security, as instant messaging services use a public network

>[!WARNING]- When communicating by instant messaging, take note of the following:
>- Do not expect an immediate reply. The person you are messaging might be busy and will reply once he or she is available.
>- Keep your messages short and to the point.
>- Do not type your messages using uppercase as it can be interpreted as shouting.
>- Be polite.
>- Do not use slang words and abbreviations. This might save you time, but it can also confuse others if they are not aware of the meaning.

#### VOIP
is a type of digital communication that allows the user to speak with one or more users over the internet.
>[!column|flex no-t]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Pros
>>- VoIP is much cheaper than using traditional telecommunication services
>>- It can help with productivity as you can have face-to-face meetings with colleagues in different cities
>>- It saves time and money as you can have face-to-face business meetings without having to travel to the client
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Cons
>>- You need an active internet connection
>>- Audio quality depends on the quality of your internet connection
>>- Some VoIP programs use large amounts of data

>[!WARNING]- When communicating using VoIP, take note of the following:
>- Be polite and speak clearly.
>- Indicate that you are listening to the person with whom you are speaking.
>- Repeat important details to ensure that you understand them correctly.
>- Do not be afraid to ask questions if something is not clear.

#### Video Conferencing
- Everyone can see you, all the time. This is not an audio conference, just because you are not speaking does not mean others in the conference can’t still see you.
- Be punctual and courteous. Introduce yourself and take note of other attendees’ names so you can address them by name. Turn off ringers for your other phones. Treat this just like you would an on-site meeting.
- No multi-tasking, we can see you. Look at your screen, pay attention to others and when speaking make sure to look at your camera.
- If it is improper for a face-to-face meeting, then it doesn’t work for video either. Don’t click your pen, tap on your desk or anything else annoying or distracting. Avoid yawning, gum chewing, etc.
- Make sure you have good light. Adjust lighting or use a portable light source to make sure you have good light shining at you from the front. You can overdo it too, so experiment until you find a good balance. Try pointing a strong desk lamp at the wall you’re facing. You get good front light without having to look directly into a harsh light.
- Do not eat! You may enjoy a glass of water or coffee, but drinking a glass of wine or a bottle of beer is not acceptable. Do not smoke during the meetings either.
- Video allows us to do face-to-face meetings right from our virtual office. Even though we all enjoy sitting in a short and t-shirt in our virtual offices, it is not appropriate when you are called into a virtual meeting. Business casual at all times is the new rule. If you have a planned customer call you should consider dressing the same as you would for an on-site meeting.
- Do video calls from your desk or other appropriate location. Lying on the couch (or anywhere) with your pc on your chest or stomach doesn’t present a flattering view.
- If you have a cluttered work space, make sure it’s not showing up on camera. Consider removing award plaques from other (competitor) companies on your wall.
- Make sure to have current client version loaded before scheduled calls. Test your audio and/or video before a scheduled call.
- Avoid high traffic areas. Sometimes it’s hard to avoid but do not position yourself where other people will be parading through the view of the camera on a regular basis.
- Close unused applications, video can be CPU/memory intensive.
- Avoid creating pixilation! Do not wear stripes, or anything with a heavy pattern. If you have vertical mini-blinds do not have them in the background. Minimise your hand gestures and body/head movements as well.
- Consider posting your comment/question in the chat window.
- Picture in Picture is your best reference, you can see yourself and your surroundings just as others on the call can. Pay close attention to what you see there, and make adjustments as necessary.
- DO NOT video while driving.
