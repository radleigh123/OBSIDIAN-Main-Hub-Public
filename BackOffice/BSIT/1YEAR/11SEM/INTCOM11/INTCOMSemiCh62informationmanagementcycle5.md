## Present Information
Now that you have collected, analyzed and processed the data, the last step is to present all the data and information that you have collected so that it is easy to understand the main focus and outcome of the research. You can use the following methods to do this:
- [[INTCOMSemiCh62informationmanagementcycle5#Graphs & Tables|Use graphs and tables]]
- [[INTCOMSemiCh62informationmanagementcycle5#Presentations|Create a presentation]]
- [[INTCOMSemiCh62informationmanagementcycle5#Create a website|Create a website]]
- [[INTCOMSemiCh62informationmanagementcycle5#Reports|Write a report]]

### Graphs & Tables
Table users visualize trends and comparisons by allowing them to organize the data; graphs help to represent the information visually.

### Presentations
PowerPoint presentations allow users to create a visual presentation of their findings through the use of slides.
- **Keep it simple**: Do not include too much information on a single slide.
- **Keep it short**: Try and present your information using as few slides as possible. This will keep your audience attentive and interested. However, do not leave out important information while trying to keep it short.
- **Do not use too many animations**: Excessive use of animations can cause the audience to get bored and lose attention.
- **Choose a font size and colour that are easy to read**: It is important to make sure that the audience will be able to read the text on your presentation, no matter where they are sitting. If the font is too small, or the text colour is unclear, many people might not be able to follow your presentation.
- **Use graphics and charts**: Instead of just having text, graphics and charts can be used to present your information in an easy-to-read and understand format.
- **Use the notes**: PowerPoint allows the user to make notes for each slide. This is especially useful to help you remember your main talking points for each slide.

### Create a website
This website will contain the same basic information that you would write in a report, with the difference being that the website will contain a more summarized version of the information.
- **Simple**: Simpler is better; websites should not contain too many design features, especially if those features serve no purpose.
- **Understandable**: The target audience of a website should be able to understand everything on the website without any difficulty.
- **Purposeful**: Websites should have a clear purpose, and every design and programming decision should work toward this purpose.
- **Useful**: A website should be useful and easy to use.
- **Consistent**: The design of a website should be consistent. This will make the website easier to understand and also make the website’s identity clearer.
- **Visually appealing**: It is important to remember that even the most simplest, understandable, purposeful, useful and consistent website will not be used if people do not like looking at it.

### Reports
A <mark class="hltr-blue">report</mark> is a form of communication that provides data and information of an event or incident. It is used to inform another person or party of the facts surrounding the event.

A report can be written in an informal or formal style.
>[!column|no-t flex]
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Formal report
>> is a short report; usually consisting of one to three pages. It provides information, but contains little to no research.
>> It makes use of personal language and is normally very direct.
>
>>[!NOTE|clean no-i collapse] Informal report
>> is usually longer, contains facts obtained from the research and analysis of data, and is more direct.

>[!ABSTRACT]+ Writing a report
>1. **Introduction**: The introduction is used to state the purpose of the report and provides a background on the issue. It is important to use your knowledge of the subject to provide a clear description of the problem that has occurred, as well as the solution that was implemented.
>2. **Body**: The body of the report will consist of a summary of information found from various sources such as the internet, books, surveys and so on. Information should be supported by graphs and other evidence such as the output of database queries. This will be followed by an analysis of the information you found. On the basis of the information found, a possible solution to the problem should be formulated. Any references to information sources should be acknowledged (cited). Care should be taken to avoid plagiarism by using your own words.
>3. **Conclusion**: This section is used to indicate whether or not the solution was a success and if any other solutions might be needed. If the solution was not successful, you need to include which steps you are planning to follow in order to make sure that the problem is resolved.

> Spreadsheets and databases can be used to organize and interpret any collected data by using tables and graphs.
> From these, the user will be able to determine trends and patterns that will provide information that can be used in your formal report.

- [A]  Always remember that it is important to write your report as soon as possible.
	- This is to ensure that you include all the details that you have observed.

>[!HINT]- Present Information
> The final step in answering our question is to take all the information and data that we obtained from the questionnaire, data analysis and secondary information sources, and present it in a way that answers our main question. In order to do this, we decided to use a professional report.
> A formal or professional report is an official report that contains a detailed data analysis, research, as well as the necessary information to make business decisions. Because of this, formal reports are usually used for problem solving. Examples of formal reports include the following:
> - Inspection reports
> - Safety reports
> - Audits
> - Annual reports
> A brief, well-structured report that has clear objectives will get more attention and support, and is more likely to produce the intended results than a vague, poorly constructed report that takes a long time to reach the point. To help with this, here are the steps that you should take when writing a professional report:
> 1. **Determine the purpose of the report:** This is the first and most important step of writing a report. You need to decide what you wish to accomplish by writing the report. Make sure to get as much information as possible to help you determine exactly what you should include in the report.
> 2. **Determine for whom you are writing the report:** Once you know the purpose of the report, you need to determine who is going to read your report. This is very important as it will help you decide how much detail needs to be included, based on the experience of the readers.
> 3. **Write the report:** Now that you have identified the purpose of the report and who the report is aimed at, you can start writing the report. Make sure to have a clear, logical structure (introduction, body and conclusion) with clear headings to show where your ideas are leading. Take care not to make any assumptions about the readers’ understanding and always explain why something is being said. Ensure that your report is long enough to fulfil its purpose, but not too long to lose the reader’s interest.
> 4. **Review and revise:** The final step of writing any report is to review and revise what you have written. Make sure that everything makes sense and that the report is indicating what you had intended. It is recommended that you revise the report once some time has passed, for example a couple of hours later. This will allow you to review the report with a fresh mind set and will help identify mistakes that you might have missed previously.

>>[!NOTE|alt-co] ##### THE STRUCTURE OF A FORMAL REPORT
>> In the first part of this section, we discussed the structure of a report, which includes an introduction, body and conclusion. However, a formal report may also include some additional sections. We will discuss these sections in three separate parts.
>> **Part 1: Front section**
>> This part of the formal report helps the reader understand what the report is about, as well as what is included in the report. This section contains the following:
>> - **Title page:** The function of the title page is to indicate what the report is about, who wrote the report, when the report was written and for whom the report was written.
>> - **Abstract:** An abstract is a summary of your report which you write after the report has been written. It should be written in the third person and in the past tense.
>> - **Table of contents:** The table of contents gives the reader an overview of the document’s contents. It also allows the reader to go directly to the section in which he or she is interested.
>> 
>> **Part 2: Main section**
>> This section contains the main report. It includes the following:
>> - **Introduction:** The introduction states the purpose of the report and provides background on the issue.
>> - **Body:** The body contains a discussion, analysis and provide possible solutions.
>> - **Conclusion:** In this section, the writer indicates whether or not the solution was a success and if any other solutions might be needed.
>> 
>> **Part 3: Back section**
>> The last section of the formal report is used to provide additional information that the reader might require. This includes the following:
>> - **References:** This is a list of the resources that were used during the writing of the report. The reader can use these references for additional reading, or to confirm the findings of the report.
>> - **Appendices:** The appendices include all documentation that was too large and bulky to be contained within the main report. This includes data sources, such as spreadsheets and databases. These documents are normally included to provide evidence for the findings of the report.
>> - **Glossary:** This is an alphabetized list of terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the report. The main function of the glossary is to provide the reader with a quick reference to terms that they might not recognize.
