## Review the solution
Problem solving does not end with the implementation of the solution. You still need to determine if the solution is effective for resolving the problem. If the chosen solution is not effective in resolving your problem, you will need to go back to Step 1 and identify why the solution did not work. Then repeat the process by choosing a new solution and testing to see if it resolves the issue.
