## Security and safeguards
The computer operating system provides support software that provides security for applications. This includes preventing malicious applications, such as a keylogger, from finding out what password you enter on your banking website.
### Avoiding security threats
The first and best defense against security threats is to prevent them from occurring in the first place.
- Use a secure password.
- Pay careful attention to the websites and links you open.
- **Do not share your sensitive information unnecessarily:** While sharing information is part of using the internet, be selective about the websites with which you choose to share your information. If you use your email address for every website you visit, do not be surprised if you start receiving a lot of spam emails!
- **Do not open suspicious emails:** Suspicious emails are emails from unknown or suspicious email addresses, emails that seem too good to be true, emails that request sensitive information, emails with executable attachments and emails with poor spelling or grammar.
- **Do not download suspicious programs or attachments:** If you do not know who the sender of the email is, never download the attachment. Even if you know who the sender is, but you are not expecting an attachment, do not open it. Your friend may have been hacked and sending you a virus!
- **Keep your antivirus application up to date:** Your antivirus application is your last line of defence against viruses. By keeping it up to date, you make sure that it knows how to detect all the newest security threats.
- **Keep your other software up to date:** Software weaknesses or vulnerabilities can be used by hackers to gain access to your computer. One of the main reasons that programmers release updates is to fix these vulnerabilities.
- **Use two-factor authentication whenever possible:** Two-factor authentication prevents anyone from logging into your accounts using just your username and password. Instead, they need a second factor (which is usually a physical device, such as your phone) to access your account. This means that your account can only be hacked by the small number of people with access to your phone.

### Safeguards against criminals, viruses, and threats
Firewalls and software, such as antivirus and anti-spyware, help protect users against the threats that they cannot see.

#### Firewalls
The firewall is responsible for monitoring all incoming and outgoing traffic on a network. If the firewall detects any traffic that is not within the defined set of security rules, it is blocked.
- ZoneAlarm
- Comodo
- GlassWire
- Windows 10 comes equipped with a basic firewall

#### Antivirus Programs
or anti-malware is a computer program designed to detect, identify, prevent and remove malware from your computer.
- Bitdefender
- Norton
- Webroot
- Windows Defender
