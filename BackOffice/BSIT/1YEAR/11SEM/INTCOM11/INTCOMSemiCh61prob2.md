## Identify possible solutions
Once you have identified the problem, you need to research ways in which to solve the problem. You can use information sources and data-gathering tools for this. Information sources include electronic sources, such as wikis and internet articles, and printed media, such as books and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Data-gathering tools include conducting questionnaires and interviews with the relevant people or targeted market. Both of these sources will provide data that can be organised in order to come up with possible solutions.
