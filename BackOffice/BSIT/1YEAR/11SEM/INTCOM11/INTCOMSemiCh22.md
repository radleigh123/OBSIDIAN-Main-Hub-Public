## Internet Attacks
Internet attacks or cyber attacks refers to an attack on the infrastructure of the web itself. Examples include the following:
- **Denial-of-service (DOS/DDOS):** The use of compromised computers to flood a server with requests for information. The attack can be regarded as successful if the server becomes so overwhelmed that normal users cannot connect to the system.
- **Cyberterrorism:** Attacks that only occurs in parts of a country’s IT infrastructure.
- **Spoofing attacks:** Spoofing attacks work by masking the attacker and making it seem as if he or she is a legitimate user. This is done by using false data to connect to the network.
- **Sniffer attacks:** Sniffer attacks works by checking the data packets sent over the network. Hackers use sniffer applications to analyze the network and access all unencrypted data being transmitted.

### Malware
Malware is a term used to describe software that can be used to cause harm to the user’s computer or computer network, without the user’s knowledge. 

This includes **viruses**, **Trojans**, **worms**, **bots** and **zombies**.

### Right to access vs Right to privacy
The important part here is to know who has the right to access data, versus your right to keep your data private. Below are a few examples to look at when it comes to the right of access versus the right to privacy:
-   If you do your work on a computer owned by someone else, they may have the right to claim access to your data files.
-   If you use online services such as Facebook you should be aware that their End User License Agreement states that whatever you post belongs to them.
-   If your school has an AUP for the computer lab that you have accepted, you may have allowed people other than yourself to access your data files.
