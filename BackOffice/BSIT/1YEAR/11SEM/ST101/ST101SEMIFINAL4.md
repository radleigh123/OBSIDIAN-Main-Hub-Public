**Circuit switching**
is one of the most common schemes utilized to build a communications network, such as the case of ordinary telephone calls.

**Packet switching**
This is a mode of transmission in which the message is broken into smaller parts (called packets) which are sent independently, and then reassemble at the ultimate destination.
