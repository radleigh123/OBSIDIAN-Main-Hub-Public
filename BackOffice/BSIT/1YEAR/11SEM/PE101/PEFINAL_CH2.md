## Core stability, Strength & Mobility Training
>[!DONE|alt-co collapse]- Objectives
>- • Importance of Core Strength for Stability; and
>- • Importance of Strength and Mobility

**Core Stability**
refers to a person's ability to stabilize their core. Stability, in this context, should be considered as an ability to control the position and movement of the core.

**Core Strength**
refers to a person's ability to stabilize their core. Stability, in this context, should be considered as an ability to control the position and movement of the core.

**Mobility Training**
helps you develop a full rang e of motion in your arms and leg s. Exercises that enhance mobility also improve your joint and muscle health. Well-developed mobility gives you an advantage in obstacle course racing and other sports as well as in day-to-day activities.

### What is the Importance of Strength for Stability

>>[!NOTE|clean collapse no-t]
>> By strengthening core stabilizers, athletes can maximize strength in their arms and leg s. Additionally, a strong core allows athletes to hold body positions for an extended period of time, such as maintaining a hydrodynamic line in the pool or during a routine in gymnastics.

>> Ultimately, developing core strength and stability enables athletes to maximize their power output and enhance game day performance.

> Improving core strength and stability can also help athletes reduce their risk of injury. Focusing on core strength can help athletes stabilize weak injury-prone areas and rehabilitate lower limb injuries.

>>[!EXAMPLE|ttl-c no-i] Importance of Mobility
>>- The importance of mobility cannot be understated. Good mobility can make a big difference to all areas of your life, whether you are a high-performance athlete or an office worker.
>>- For athletes and sports professionals at the top of their game, taking the time to work on their mobility has obvious benefits. But the importance of mobility for less active individuals is also paramount.

>>[!EXAMPLE|ttl-c no-i] Importance of Strength
>>- Having a strong core is beneficial to everyone because it allows your body to function properly. Core exercises train the muscles in your pelvis, lower back, hips and abdomen to work tog ether. This leads to better balance and stability making daily activities such as walking , running , and sitting much easier
