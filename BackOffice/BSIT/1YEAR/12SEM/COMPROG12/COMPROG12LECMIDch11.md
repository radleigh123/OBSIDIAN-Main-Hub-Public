## Learning About the Loop Structure
If making decisions is what makes programs seem smart, looping is what makes programs seem powerful. A loop is a structure that allows repeated execution of a block of statements. Within a looping structure, a Boolean expression is evaluated. If it is true, a block of statements called the loop body executes and the Boolean expression is evaluated again. The loop body can be a single statement, or a block of statements between curly braces. As long as the expression is true, the statements in the loop body continue to execute. When the Boolean evaluation is false, the loop ends. One execution of any loop is called an iteration.

In Java, you can use several mechanisms to create loops. In this chapter, you learn to use three types of loops:
-   A **while loop**, in which the loop-controlling Boolean expression is the first statement in the loop.
-   A **for loop**, which is usually used as a concise format in which to execute loops.
-   A **do…while loop**, in which the loop-controlling Boolean expression is the last statement in the loop.
