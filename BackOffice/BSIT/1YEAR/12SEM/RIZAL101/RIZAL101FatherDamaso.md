**Father Dámaso**
A Spanish friar living in the Philippines, *Father Dámaso* is an arrogant and pedantic priest who, despite having lived amongst Filipinos and hearing their confessions for over twenty years, is barely able to speak or understand Tagalog, the country’s native language. A shameless loudmouth, he is unafraid of slandering nonreligious citizens who he thinks undermine his power. [[RIZAL101Ibarra|Ibarra]] learns that this is exactly what happened between his father, [[RIZAL101DonRafael|Don Rafael]], and *Dámaso*—because Rafael refused to go to confession and supported secular means of empowering Filipino citizens, Dámaso jumped at the opportunity to cast Rafael as a heretic and a subversive.

As such, Dámaso is Ibarra’s most evident and outspoken rival, a fact Dámaso seems to leverage by taunting the young man at a dinner party one night, making allusions to Rafael’s death and insulting Ibarra’s project to build a school. Unfortunately, Ibarra is unable to ignore these provocations, and his violent response leads to his own excommunication. To make matters worse for Ibarra, Father Dámaso is very well-connected in San Diego, and he is [[RIZAL101MariaClara|María Clara]]’s godfather, which puts him in a position of power over Ibarra’s engagement (indeed, he forbids her from marrying Ibarra). María Clara later discovers that Dámaso is her real father, a fact she hopes to keep quiet at all costs because it would disgrace her deceased mother’s honor and her father’s respectability, so Dámaso gets away with his corruption.
