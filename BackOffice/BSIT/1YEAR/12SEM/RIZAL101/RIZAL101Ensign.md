**The Ensign**
- a Spaniard in charge of the Civil Guard in San Diego.

The ensign has a bitter relationship with [[RIZAL101FatherSalvi|Father Salví]], since he thinks Father Salví takes his position too seriously. 

To retaliate against Salví (who uses his religious authority to control the ensign), the ensign enforces curfews that make it difficult for the citizens of San Diego to attend church at the proper times. Given to excessive drinking and unnecessary displays of power, the ensign is married to a strong-willed Filipina woman named **[[RIZALDoñaConsolacion|Doña Consolación]]**, with whom he fights day in and day out.
