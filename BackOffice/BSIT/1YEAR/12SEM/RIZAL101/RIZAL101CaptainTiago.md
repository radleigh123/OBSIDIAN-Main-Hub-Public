**Captain Tiago (Don Santiago de los Santos)**
- A Filipino socialite and well-respected member of the country’s wealthy elite.
- Close with high-ranking clergy members like [[RIZAL101FatherSalvi|Father Salví]] and [[RIZAL101FatherDamaso|Father Dámaso]], Captain Tiago is one of the richest property owners in Manila and San Diego.

He is concerned with making sure his daughter, María Clara, marries an affluent man with ample social capital, which is one of the reasons he so quickly abandons his support of Ibarra when the friars disgrace the young man’s name. As for his own disgrace, Captain Tiago is not actually María Clara’s biological father—rather, his wife had an affair with Father Dámaso before dying in childbirth. This is perhaps why he is so concerned with keeping up the appearance of respectability, for his own wife dishonored him. As such, he is blind to the vapid posturing of people like **Doctor de Espadaña**, a fraudulent doctor for rich people, and his wife, [[RIZAL101DoñaVictorina|Doña Victorina]], an obvious social climber. When they present their nephew Linares as a possible new match for María Clara, Captain Tiago is quick to assent, thinking that such a pairing will ensure respectability.
