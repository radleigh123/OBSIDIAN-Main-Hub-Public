## Countries, Regions, and Globalization
**REGIONALISM AND THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERTANDING IT IN A GLOBALIZING WORLD**
$\qquad$From the previous lessons, you understand the processes and impacts of Globalization. From the aspect of the political to the economic aspect, globalization seemed to identify each country as a player in this worldwide phenomenon. If you understood globalization as a seemingly formal conference table with each country representatives shaking hands with one another, then you understood globalization in an optimistic manner with free trade and free market as its foundation. But for this lesson, I need you to imagine globalization as a stadium of a fight, or stadium of performances. There is this certainty that there will be losing country (usually those who do not have as many resources and machineries as others), and there will be a winning country (those who have the means to innovate success).

$\qquad$With that in mind, Regionalism was established by groups of neighboring countries as a way of coping in the “stadium of performances/fight” or the challenges Globalization.

$\qquad$Globalization has made people aware of the world in general, but it has also made Filipinos more cognizant of specific areas such as Southeast Asia. How, for instance, did the Philippines come to identify itself with the Southeast Asian region? Why is it part of a regional grouping known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN)?

$\qquad$Regionalism is a political and economic phenomenon. You can disaggregate the motivations of a particular phenomenon whether it was established through similar identities, ethics, religion, ecological sustainability, or health. Further, it is also a process. Forming of Regionalism is not inevitable, it is not a “natural process” in society. Formation of regionalism is observed to be inspired by socially emergent issues that needs to be addressed. Regionalism is constructed and defined by policymakers.

> **Regionalism**
> is defined as a political ideology that favors a specific region over a greater area. It usually results due to political separations, religious geography, cultural boundaries, linguistic regions, and managerial divisions. Regionalism emphasizes on developing the administrative power and swaying the available or some inhabitants of a region.

**COUNTRIES, REGIONS, AND GLOBALIZATION**
$\qquad$Edward D. Mansfield and Helen V. Milner state that economic and political definitions of regions vary, but there are certain basic features that everyone can agree on.

$\qquad$First, regions are “a group of countries located in the same geographically specified area” or are “an amalgamation of two regions or a combination of more than two regions” organized to regulate and “oversee flows of policy choices.” Second, the words regionalization and regionalism should not be interchanged, as the former refers to the “regional concentration of economic flows” while the latter is “a political process characterized by economic policy cooperation and coordination among countries."

Why form Regions?
A way of coping with globalization – this does not only apply on the small lesser developed countries. Forming alliances between neighboring countries is also a tactic used by the developed countries in terms of protecting or solidifying their strengths. Following alliances with different motivations are briefly discussed below:
- For military defense
	- Example: NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Formed during the Cold War when several Western European countries plus the United States agreed to protect Europe against the threat of the Soviet Union...The Soviet Union imploded in December 1991, but NATO remains in place.
- For pooling of resources
	- Example: OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), in order to get better returns for their exports, as well as expand their leverage against trading partners, [and] regulate the production and sale of oil…Iran, Iraq, Kuwait Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela…established OPEC in 1960.
- To protect a country’s independence from the pressures of superpower politics
	- Example: NAM (Non-Aligned Movement) …Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia created the NAM in 1961 to pursue world peace and international cooperation, human rights national sovereignty, racial and national equality, non-intervention, and peaceful conflict resolution.
- To mitigate economic crisis
	- The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis The International Monetary Fund (IMF) tried to reverse the crisis, but it was only after the ASEAN countries along with China, Japan, and South Korea agreed to establish an emergency fund to anticipate a crisis that the Asian economies stabilized. The crisis made ASEAN more “unified and coordinated”.

$\qquad$Globalization and regionalization are the same for they refer to integration. Their difference lies on the scope. Globalization is worldwide while regionalization focuses on a specific geographical region. As a response to world homogenization and division, regionalism that comes in various forms of regional alternatives to globalization spawned within and among regions in Asia. Asian integration did not happen based on one historical event for there were different factors that led to this alliance.

$\qquad$Asian regionalism is a new concept among the continental communities. New to cooperation and collaboration goals, it has the 50-year-old ASEAN group and the failed East Asia Economic Group (EAEG). The ASEAN community is comprised of three pillars – political security community, economic community, and socio-cultural community.

$\qquad$ASEAN has also partnered with three EAST Asian countries – China, Japan, and South Korea. It is called the ASEAN + 3. Its goal is to address the 1997 Asian financial crisis and help each other cope with the crisis. In this context, ASEAN has concretized regionalism in the Asian region.

$\qquad$There are some aspects that led to a greater Asian integration. First, integration has been market-driven. Within Asia, there are a variety of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations, and infrastructures that are put in place for countries to engage in exchange. Second, formal institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) were established. Conceived in the 1960a, ADB promotes social and economic development in Asia. Third, economic grants and overseas development assistance are made available by better Asian economies. For example, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) aims to work on human security and quality growth. Fourth, production networks have expanded. Economies are mainly on comparative advantage through the regional division of labor. Fifth, cooperation among the ASEAN and East Asian countries ensued the ASEAN + 3 Financial Ministers’ Process that established two economic structures – the Chiang Mai Initiative and the Asian Bond Markets Initiative. The process aims to strengthen policy dialogue, coordination, and collaboration on common financial, monetary, and fiscal issues.

**NON-STATE REGIONALISM**
$\qquad$It is not only states that agree to work together in the name of a single cause (or causes). Communities also engage in regional organizing. This “new regionalism” varies in form; they can be “tiny associations that include no more than a few actors and focus on a single issue, or huge continental unions that address a multitude of common problems from territorial defense to food security.”

$\qquad$Organizations representing this “new regionalism” likewise rely on the power of individuals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and associations to link up with one another in pursuit of a particular goal (or goals). Finally, “new regionalism” is identified with reformists who share the same “values, norms, institutions, and system that exist outside of the traditional, established mainstream institutions and systems.”

$\qquad$Unlike with the first part of the discussion having the basic feature of forming a Region is the geographic location, with Non-State Regionalism, countries actually form an alliance based on their common motivations regardless of their geographic proximity.
The way they identify problems may:
- Differ as to **form**
	- **Tiny associations vs. Huge continental unions**
	  Non-state regionalism is relatively as a smaller association compared to many established regions before them. Participating countries in non-state regions may be less compared to the participating countries in established alliance created before them.
- Differ as to **tactics and strategies**
	- **Working with the government vs. Not working with the government**
	  Some organizations partner with governments to initiate social change. Those who work with governments (“legitimizers”) participate in “institutional mechanisms that afford some civil society groups voice and influence in technocratic policy-making processes.”
	  For example, the ASEAN issued its Human Rights Declaration in 2009, but the regional body left it to member countries to apply the declaration’s principles as they see fit. Aware that the democratic rights are limited in many ASEAN countries, “new regionalism” organizations used this official declaration to pressure these governments to pass laws and regulations that protect and promote human rights.
	  In Southeast Asia, the organization of an ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights was in part the result of non-government organizations and civil society groups pushing to “prevent discrimination, uphold political freedom, and promote democracy and human rights throughout the region.
	  Non-state regionalism may also have a relatively difficult budget source compared to alliances established before them.
- Differ as to **causes**
	- **Specialized and general**
	  The Migrant Forum in Asia is another regional network of NGOs and trade unions “committed to protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of migrant workers.” These organizations’ primary power lies in their moral standing and their ability to combine lobbying with pressure politics. Unfortunately, most of them are poorly financed, which places them at a disadvantage when dealing with their official counterparts who have large state funds. Their impact in global politics is, therefore, limited.

**CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES TO REGIONALISM**
- **Resurgence of Militant Nationalism and Populism**
  The refusal to dismantle North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) after the collapse of the Soviet Union has become the basis of the anti-NATO rhetoric of Vladimir Putin in Russia. Now, even the relationship of the United States – the alliance’s core member – with NATO has become problematic after Donald Trump’s standpoint regarding NATO saying that it does nothing for America any more than taking advantage of the military resources without giving anything in return.
- **Continuing Economic Crisis**
  \#Brexit – Amid the worsening economic crisis, Britain finally aimed for a more flexible economic transactions that the European Union alliance was limiting them for the longest time.
- **Sovereignty vs. Regional Stability**
  ASEAN members continue to disagree over the extent to which the member countries should sacrifice their sovereignty for the sake of regional stability. Take for example the China and Philippine territorial dispute. Even the international ruling favored the Philippines, votes and statements from fellow ASEAN countries were about pursuing diplomacy over confrontation against China. Cambodia and Laos led the opposition favoring diplomacy over confrontation, but the real reason was the dramatic increase of Chinese investments and economic aid to these countries.
- **Differing Visions of What Regionalism Should Be For**
  Western governments may see reginal organizations not simply as economic formations but also as instruments of political democratization. Non-western and developing countries, however, may have different view regarding globalization, development, and democracy. Singapore, China, and Russia are some of the countries that are not in favor of this democratic style of decision-making. The lengthy debate before an economic policy rolls out simply means a delayed in probable economic growth. Constant public inquiry about economic projects and debates slow down implementation or lead to unclear outcomes.
