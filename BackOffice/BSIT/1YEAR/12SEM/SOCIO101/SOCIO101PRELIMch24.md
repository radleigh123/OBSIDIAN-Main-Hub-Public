## Summary of the lesson
Globalization is the primary driving force of the contemporary world. It is a process that is complex and multifaceted that occurs at multiple levels and affects people differently. Although perceived to be primarily an economic process, it should be viewed through various lenses that consider multiple theories and perspectives. Globalization theories see it as a process that can either increase homogeneity or heterogeneity. Concepts associated with homogeneity are cultural imperialism, media imperialism, neoliberalism and Mcdonalization. On the other hand, heterogeneity is closely associated with glocalization. Meanwhile, global cultural flows are perceived to take place in the form of cultural differentialism, cultural hybridization and cultural convergence.
