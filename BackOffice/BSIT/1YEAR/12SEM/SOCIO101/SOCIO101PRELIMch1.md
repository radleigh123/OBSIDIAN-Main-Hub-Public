# The Globalization of Economic Relations
many definitions of `globalization`:
1. refers to the process of increased interconnectedness and interdependence among countries, individuals, and organizations around the world.
2. it "may be thought of initially as the widening, deepening and speeding up of worldwide interconnectedness in all aspects of contemporary social life"
3. is best thought of as a multidimensional phenomenon.

**Economic Globalization**
- a type of globalization that refers to the increased flow of goods, services, money, and people across the world.
- is a historical process, it refers to the increasing integration of economies around the world, particularly through the movement of goods, services, and capital across borders. The movement of people (labor) and knowledge (technology) across international borders. Interconnected dimensions such as:
	- globalization of trade goods & services;
	- ... of financial and capital markets;
	- ... of technology & communication and;
	- .... of production

### Is Economic Globalization a new phenomenon?
> no single definition of globalization, there is no consensus on its origin, either.

**Gills and Thompson** (2006:1)
- globalization processes have been happening since humans first migrated from Africa to other parts of the world, or at least since the 16th century when the Americas were connected to Afro-Eurasia through trade and other activities.

**Frank and Gills** (1993:3)
- origin of globalization stretches back at least 5,000 years’. The best known example of archaic globalization is the **Silk Road**, which connected Asia, Africa and Europe
	- **long duration** - a slow-moving, framework for historical analysis

**Adam Smith** (1776)
- two greatest achievements in human history:
	- [W] discovery of America by Christopher Columbus (1492)
	- [&] discovery of sea route to India by Vasco de Gama (1498)

The real breakthrough came only in the **19th century**. he period from 1870 to 1913 is often referred to as the "**golden age**" of globalization characterized by peace, free trade, and financial and economic stability.

### Convergence vs Divergence

**Structuralism** - is a ‘cluster of theories which emerged in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s … and share the idea that North and South are in a structural relationship one to another; that is that both areas are part of a structure that determines the pattern of relationships that emerges’ (Brown, 2001: 197)

### IMS (International Monetary Systems)
is a set of principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures that govern cross-border transactions, particularly trade and investment.

According to Krasner, the IMS is the result of actors' converging expectations. In the liberal tradition, the main role of the IMS is to facilitate cross-border transactions.

### The Gold Standard
The first modern international monetary system (IMS) was established in the early 19th century when the UK adopted gold mono-metallism in 1821. In 1867, the US and European nations shifted to a gold standard which became the international monetary regime by 1880 with the participation of roughly 70% of nations. The gold standard functioned as a fixed exchange rate regime with gold as the only international reserve, and countries were obligated to exchange their national currencies for gold at official exchange rates. The gold standard ensured trade balance and competitiveness through an automatic price-specie flow mechanism, but resulted in a loss of monetary policy autonomy for deficit nations who had to initiate deflationary policies.

The gold standard was a successful international monetary system (IMS) that brought stability and order to foreign exchange markets, encouraged elimination of balance-of-payments problems, and provided access to international credits. However, the outbreak of World War I brought an end to the gold standard as participating nations abandoned convertibility and gold export. The UK attempted a return to the gold standard in 1925, but failed due to overvalued pound sterling and competition from the US and France. In the 1930s, the change from the gold standard to competitive devaluations and floating was not just a shift in financial regimes, but also reflected deep structural changes and the influence of labor in domestic politics that made governments reluctant to adopt deflationary policies.

### The Bretton Woods System and its dissolution
The Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 resulted in the creation of the gold-exchange standard, a system where the US dollar was the only convertible currency and all other participating currencies were fixed to it. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were also established with the latter tasked to promote international financial cooperation and support international trade. The IMF was also expected to provide short-term financial assistance in case of balance of payments difficulties. The Bretton Woods system allowed countries to correct their official exchange rate to eliminate balance of payment deficits but adjustments were infrequent. The UK faced pressure from speculators to devalue its currency and faced capital outflow when it abstained from devaluations.

The US dollar became the dominant currency after the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, where the gold-exchange standard was adopted with the US dollar as the only convertible currency. The US maintained a balance of payments surplus until Europe regained its economic power, causing a persistent deficit for the US. By the mid-1960s, the dollar was overvalued, leading to a depletion of US gold reserves and inflationary pressures. In 1971, the US abandoned the gold-exchange standard, leading to the Smithsonian Agreement for a controlled exchange rate mechanism and later, managed floating of currencies. In 1985, the Plaza Agreement led to a devaluation of the US dollar, but Japan was one of the main losers from the action. The Washington Consensus in the 1990s saw a rise in neoliberalism, with the IMF requiring reforms in exchange for financial assistance. The deregulation of financial sectors and liberalization of capital transactions in the late 1980s by emerging markets, combined with their soft pegging regimes, made them vulnerable and led to the financial crisis in Mexico in 1994 and East Asia in 1997-98.

The Washington Consensus and its free market ideology have faced criticism for its approach to development. Stiglitz (2002) argued that the IMF's rigid conditionalities, based on free-market policies like liberalization and privatization, failed to deliver results in an environment with imperfect or incomplete markets and inadequate institutions. Wallerstein (2005) commented that this change in economic thinking in the late 1980s and early 1990s brought about globalization and advocated for export-oriented productive activities, and the elimination of capital transfer controls and nationalized industries.

### European Monetary Integration
The United States initially wanted to implement the Morgenthau Plan to downsize the German economy after WWII, but quickly abandoned it in response to the rise of communism in Eastern Europe and socialist/communist parties in the West. The US instead advocated for a strong Germany and Western Europe and implemented the Marshall Plan to help with post-war reconstruction. Western Europe's miraculous growth performance led to closer cooperation and the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and the European Economic Community in 1957. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system placed pressure on the EEC, leading to the creation of the European Monetary System in 1979. The success of the EMS and the abolishment of capital controls opened the way for the creation of the European Economic and Monetary Union in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. By 1999, the member states of the EMU abandoned their national currencies and delegated monetary policy to the European Central Bank, leading to increased trade, capital transactions, and macroeconomic stability. The first ten years of the EMU were considered a success.

The global financial and economic crisis of 2008-9 posed challenges for the European Union (EU) and highlighted design flaws in the euro-area. The EU is not a fiscal union, so it doesn't have specific means to handle financial difficulties. The EU enacted a three-pillar financial rescue program in response to the crisis, but it was only designed for a temporary period. The future of the European Monetary Union (EMU) depends on the willingness of member states to make changes to the governance of the Eurozone, such as developing it into a fiscal union supported by pan-European banking supervision. This may eventually lead to the formation of a political union in the future.

### International Trade and Trade Policies
The comparative advantage theory by David Ricardo states that a country can benefit from trade even if its trading partner is more effective in producing both goods, as every nation has a comparative advantage in something. However, trade also has political consequences, with different distributional effects and hindering the development prospects of the lower value added producing nation. Friedrich List's "infant industry argument" suggests that temporarily restricting the free flow of goods can establish a national industry and foster long-term growth and political power. The realist and mercantilist school of thought view protection as a way to secure national objectives.

Reformist and radical theorists believe that unequal exchange is a systemic characteristic of the modern world economy and hinders development in the periphery while benefiting the core. Europe and its Western offshoots gained control of the rest of the world, creating a global division of labor that is unfair. The periphery should adopt protectionism to break ties with the core. International trade can also trigger tensions within a country as gains from trade affect the well-being of citizens differently. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem states that trade benefits the domestically abundant factor of production and weakens the scarce factor, increasing the political power of the owners of the abundant factor. This creates a permanent source for protectionism from the least to the most developed economies, including the EU and the US.

### Unilateral Trade Order
World War I, however, was a dramatic blow to free trade. Protectionism, in turn, was detrimental to development, peace and stability (Ruggie, 1982). Two rounds of World Economic Conferences in 1927 and 1933 failed to deliver tariff reductions and exchangerate stabilization because of the unwillingness of the United States to take the role of the hegemon as a successor of a weakened Great Britain. Domestic politics in the United States evidently turned against restrictions-free trade as a consequence of the Great Depression of 1929–33. The Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 increased tariffs to record-high levels in the United States. Retaliation was the rational response from trading partners and international trade dropped by one- to two-thirds as a consequence (Irwin, 1998).16 The enactment of the US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934 eventually put a stop to any further decline in international trade. The Act allowed the president to determine trade policies and also eased the pressure put on the Congress for protection. In practice, the Act was a return to the principle of MFN and it provided a solid base for a renewed international trade regime following World War II. 

The World War I was a major setback to free trade and led to widespread protectionism. The Great Depression of 1929-33 also contributed to the decline of free trade as domestic politics in the US turned against it. The Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 increased tariffs to record levels, causing a significant drop in international trade. The US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to determine trade policies, marking a return to the principle of most-favored nation and providing a solid foundation for a new international trade regime after World War II.

### Multilateralism: From the GATT to the WTO
After World War II, the United States became a leader in international trade and the dollar became a world currency. The country was the largest aid donor and its manufacturing accounted for 60% of the world's total, with exports making up a third of the world's total. The new international trade regime was a compromise between the liberal approach of the 19th century and the economic nationalism of the inter-war period and was supposed to be governed by the International Trade Organization (ITO). However, due to US congressional vetoes, nations instead coordinated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which carried out a series of multilateral trade negotiations, starting with tariff cuts in the first five rounds and later expanding to reduction of non-tariff barriers and codes of conduct. The most significant negotiations were the Uruguay Round in 1986-1994. The changing pattern of international trade, with trade shifting to transnational corporations, resulted in a change in the politics of trade with global corporate capital having more influence over the organization and distribution of economic power and resources.

The Uruguay Round extended trade rules to new areas such as agriculture, invited developing countries to participate in trade negotiations, and created a more efficient dispute settlement mechanism. The major outcomes were agreements on trade-related investment measures, trade in services, and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, aimed mostly at developing countries with potential service markets. This resulted in the formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as an international trade institution. Seattle in 1999 and Doha in 2001 saw the strength of NGOs and anti-globalization movements, but failed to reach concrete results. The stalemate between major countries led to the formation of the Group of 20, a pressure group of developing countries within the WTO.

### Developing countries and International Trade
Developing nations did not actively participate in multilateral trade negotiations for a long time, largely due to their inward-looking import-substitution industrialization strategy and reluctance of advanced economies to open their markets to commodities in which developing countries had a comparative advantage. UNCTAD was established in 1964 to promote trade and cooperation between developed and developing nations, but these initiatives were swept away by the two oil crises and the economic stagnation of the 1980s. The Uruguay Round marked a change in this state of affairs, with developed countries expected to open their markets and developing countries accepting regulation on intellectual property rights and services. However, agriculture exports from developing countries remain blocked, which prevents them from fully integrating into the global economy. The current trade regime, especially the WTO, is criticized for its asymmetry, where national boundaries do not matter for trade and capital flows, but matter for technology and labor flows, leading to inequality in the rules of globalization.
