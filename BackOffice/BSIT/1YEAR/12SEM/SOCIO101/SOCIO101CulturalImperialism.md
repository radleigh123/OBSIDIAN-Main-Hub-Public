## Cultural Imperialism
Cultural imperialism is a concept that means that <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">a given culture influences other cultures</mark>. This pertains to the imposition by one usually politically or economically dominant community of various aspects of its own culture onto another nondominant community. It is cultural in the sense that the customs, traditions, religion, language, social and moral norms, and other aspects of the imposing community are distinct from, though often closely related to, the economic and political systems that shape the other community. It is a form of imperialism in that the imposing community<mark class="hltr-blue"> forcefully extends the authority of its way of life</mark> over the other population by either transforming or replacing aspects of the nondominant community's culture. Cultural imperialism become one of the primary instruments of colonization. While colonization was almost always initiated by some kind of military intervention, its full effects were achieved through practices of cultural imperialism.

Fueled by a belief in the superiority of their own way of life, colonizers used <mark class="hltr-blue">law, education, and/or military force</mark> to impose various aspects of their own culture onto the target population. Motivated, in part, by a desire to purge local populations of allegedly barbaric., uncivilized customs and mores, colonizers also knew that the best way to mitigate resistance by the colonized was to <mark class="hltr-blue">eradicate as far as possible all traces of their former way of life</mark>. During the 20th century, cultural imperialism was no longer so closely inked with military intervention but rather with the exertion of economic and political influence by some powerful countries over less powerful countries.
