## Dynamics of Local and Global Culture: Perspectives on Global Cultural Flows
Globalization is characterized by the movements and spread of various cultures globally.
In the contemporary world, cultures flow through non-material digital forms (like different
forms of media especially social media). There are three perspectives on how cultures flow
globally.
1. **Cultural Differentialism**. This emphasizes the fact that cultures are essentially different and are only superficially affected by global flows. The interaction of cultures is deemed to contain the potential for catastrophic collision.(Note: <mark class="hltr-blue">This usually results to state wars and racial discrimination as well as culture clash</mark>)
2. **Cultural Hybridization**. This emphasizes the integration of local and global cultures. Globalization is considered as a creative process which gives rise to hybrid entities that are not reducible to either global or the local. (Note: <mark class="hltr-blue">This is similar to the concept of "glocalization". New culture is made out of the local and foreign culture</mark>.)
3. **Cultural Convergence**. This stresses the homogeneity introduced by globalization. Cultures are deemed to be radically altered by strong flows, while cultural imperialism happens when one culture imposes itself on and tends to destroy at least parts of another culture. (Note: <mark class="hltr-blue">This perceives that the world is having a universal global culture that will eventually dissolve the local culture.</mark>)
