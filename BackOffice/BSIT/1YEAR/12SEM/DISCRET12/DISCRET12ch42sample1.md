Construct a truth table for the statement form $(p ∧ q) ∨ ∼r$.

**Solution:**
Make columns headed $p$, $q$, $r$, $p ∧ q$, $∼r$, and $(p ∧ q) ∨ ∼r$. Enter the eight logically possible combinations of truth values for $p$, $q$, and $r$ in the three left-most columns. Then fill in the truth values for $p ∧ q$ and for $∼r$. Complete the table by considering the truth values for $(p ∧ q)$ and for $∼r$ and the definition of an **or** statement. Since an **or** statement is **false** only when both components are **false**, the only rows in which the entry is **F** are the third, fifth, and seventh rows because those are the only rows in which the expressions $p ∧ q$ and $∼r$ are both **false**. The entry for all the other rows is **T**.

The essential point about assigning truth values to compound statements is that it allows you—using logic alone—to judge the truth of a compound statement on the basis of your knowledge of the truth of its component parts. Logic does not help you determine the truth or falsity of the component statements. Rather, logic helps link these separate pieces of information together into a coherent whole.
