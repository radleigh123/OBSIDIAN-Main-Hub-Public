## Tautologies and Contradictions
It has been said that all of mathematics reduces to *tautologies*. Although this is formally true, most working mathematicians think of their subject as having substance as well as form. Nonetheless, an intuitive grasp of basic logical tautologies is part of the equipment of anyone who reasons with mathematics.

>[!INFO|alt-co collapse] DEFINITION
> A **tautology** is a statement form that is always true regardless of the truth values of the individual statements substituted for its statement variables. A statement whose form is a tautology is a **tautological statement**.
> &nbsp;
> A **contradication** is a statement form that is always false regardless of the truth values of the individual statements substituted for its statement variables. A statement whose form is a contradication is a **contradictory statement**.

According to this definition, the truth of a tautological statement and the falsity of a contradictory statement are due to the logical structure of the statements themselves and are independent of the meanings of the statements.
