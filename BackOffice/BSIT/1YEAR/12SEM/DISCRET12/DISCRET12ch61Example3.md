## Example 61.3: Negations of If-Then Statements
Write negations for each of the following statements:
**a.** If my car is in the repair shop, then I cannot get to class.
**b.** If Sara lives in Athens, then she lives in Greece.

**Solution:**
**a.** My car is in the repair shop and I can get to class.
**b.** Sara lives in Athens and she does not live in Greece. (Sara might live in Athens, Georgia; Athens, Ohio; or Athens, Wisconsin.)

It is tempting to write the negation of an if-then statement as another if-then statement. Please resist that temptation!

>[!WARNING|alt-co ttl-c]
> Remember that the negation of an **if-then** statement does not start with the word **if**.
