## Example 62.2: Writing the Converse and the Inverse
Write the converse and inverse of each of the following statements:
**a.** If Howard can swim across the lake, then Howard can swim to the island.
**b.** If today is Easter, then tomorrow is Monday.

**Solution:**
**a.** *Converse*: If Howard can swim to the island, then Howard can swim across the lake.
*Inverse*: If Howard cannot swim across the lake, then Howard cannot swim to the island. 

**b.** *Converse*: If tomorrow is Monday, then today is Easter.
*Inverse*: If today is not Easter, then tomorrow is not Monday.

>[!WARNING|alt-co ttl-c]
> Many people believe that if a conditional statement is **true**, then its converse and inverse must also be **true**. ***This is not correct!***

Note that while the statement “*If today is Easter, then tomorrow is Monday*” is always true, both its converse and inverse are **false** on every Sunday except Easter.

>3. The converse and the inverse of a conditional statement are logically equivalent to each other.
