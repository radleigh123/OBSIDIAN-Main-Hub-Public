## Only If and the Biconditional
To say “*$p$ only if $q$*” means that $p$ can take place only if $q$ takes place also. That is, if $q$ does not take place, then $p$ cannot take place. Another way to say this is that if $p$ occurs, then $q$ must also occur (by the logical equivalence between a statement and its contrapositive).

> “*$p$ only if $q$*” does not mean “*$p$ if $q$*.”

Note that it is possible for “*$p$ only if $q$*” to be **true** at the some time that “*$p$ if $q$*” is **false**. For instance, to say that John will break the world’s record only if he runs the mile in under four minutes does not mean that John will break the world’s record if he runs the mile in under four minutes. His time could be under four minutes but still not be fast enough to break the record.

The biconditional has the following truth table:

In order of operations $↔$ is coequal with $→.$ As with $∧$ and $∨,$ the only way to indicate precedence between them is to use parentheses.

According to the separate definitions of **if** and **only if**, saying “*$p$ if, and only if, $q$*” should mean the same as saying both “*$p$ if $q$*” and “*$p$ only if $q$*.” The following annotated truth table shows that this is the case:
