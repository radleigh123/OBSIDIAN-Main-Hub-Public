## Remarks
1. In logic, a hypothesis and conclusion are not required to have related subject matters.
   In ordinary speech we never say things like “If computers are machines, then Babe Ruth was a baseball player” or “If 2 + 2 = 5, then Mickey Mouse is president of the United States.” We formulate a sentence like “If p then q” only if there is some connection of content between p and q.
   
   In logic, however, the two parts of a conditional statement need not have related meanings. The reason? If there were such a requirement, who would enforce it? What one person perceives as two unrelated clauses may seem related to someone else. There would have to be a central arbiter to check each conditional sentence before anyone could use it, to be sure its clauses were in proper relation. This is impractical, to say the least!
   
   Thus a statement like “if computers are machines, then Babe Ruth was a baseball player” is allowed, and it is even called true because both its hypothesis and its conclusion are true. Similarly, the statement “If 2 + 2 = 5, then Mickey Mouse is president of the United States” is allowed and is called true because its hypothesis is false, even though doing so may seem ridiculous.
   
   In mathematics it often happens that a carefully formulated definition that successfully covers the situations for which it was primarily intended is later seen to be satisfied by some extreme cases that the formulator did not have in mind. But those are the breaks, and it is important to get into the habit of exploring definitions fully to seek out and understand all their instances, even the unusual ones.

2. In informal language, simple conditionals are often used to mean biconditionals.
   The formal statement “*$p$ if, and only if, $q$*” is seldom used in ordinary language. Frequently, when people intend the biconditional they leave out either the **and only if** or the **if and**. That is, they say either “*$p$ if $q$*” or “*$p$ only if $q$*” when they really mean “*$p$ if, and only if, $q$*.” For example, consider the statement “*You will get dessert if, and only if, you eat your dinner*.” Logically, this is equivalent to the conjunction of the following two statements. 
   
   *Statement 1*: If you eat your dinner, then you will get dessert. 
   *Statement 2*: You will get dessert only if you eat your dinner. or If you do not eat your dinner, then you will not get dessert.
   
   Now how many parents in the history of the world have said to their children “You will get dessert if, and only if, you eat your dinner”? Not many! Most say either “*If you eat your dinner, you will get dessert*” (these take the positive approach—they emphasize the reward) or “*You will get dessert only if you eat your dinner*” (these take the negative approach—they emphasize the punishment). Yet the parents who promise the reward intend to suggest the punishment as well, and those who threaten the punishment will certainly give the reward if it is earned. Both sets of parents expect that their conditional statements will be interpreted as biconditionals.
   
   Since we often (correctly) interpret conditional statements as biconditionals, it is not surprising that we may come to believe (mistakenly) that conditional statements are always logically equivalent to their inverses and converses. In formal settings, however, statements must have unambiguous interpretations. If-then statements can’t sometimes mean “*if-then*” and other times mean “*if and only if.*” When using language in mathematics, science, or other situations where precision is important, it is essential to interpret if-then statements according to the formal definition and not to confuse them with their converses and inverses.
