## Example 63.1: Converting Only If to If-Then
Rewrite the following statement in **if-then** form in two ways, one of which is the contrapositive of the other.
<center>John will break the world’s record for the mile run only if he runs the mile in under four minutes.</center>

**Solution:**
*Version 1*: If John does not run the mile in under four minutes, then he will not break the world’s record.
*Version 2*: If John breaks the world’s record, then he will have run the mile in under four minutes.
