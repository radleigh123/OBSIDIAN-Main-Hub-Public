## Example 5.4: Applying De Morgan’s Laws
Write negations for each of the following statements: 
**a.** John is 6 feet tall and he weighs at least 200 pounds.
**b.** The bus was late or Tom’s watch was slow.

**Solution:**
**a.** John is not 6 feet tall or he weighs less than 200 pounds.
**b.** The bus was not late and Tom’s watch was not slow. 

Since the statement “*neither $p$ nor $q$*” means the same as “*$∼p$ and $∼q$*,” an alternative answer for (**b**) is “*Neither was the bus late nor was Tom’s watch slow*.” 

If $x$ is a particular real number, saying that $x$ is not less than $2\ (x ≮ 2)$ means that $x$ does not lie to the left of $2$ on the number line. This is equivalent to saying that either $x = 2$ or $x$ lies to the right of $2$ on the number line $(x = 2\ \ \text{or}\ \ x > 2)$. Hence,
<center><strong>x ≮ 2</strong> is equivalent to <strong>x ≥ 2</strong>.</center>
