## Logical Form
The central concept of deductive logic is the concept of [[DISCRET12ch4Argument|argument]] form. ^fd1d18

The <mark class="hltr-blue">assertion at the end of the sequence</mark> is called the ***<mark class="hltr-blue">conclusion</mark>***, and the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">preceding statements</mark> are called ***<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">premises</mark>***. To have confidence in the conclusion that you draw from an argument, you must be sure that the premises are acceptable on their own merits or follow from other statements that are known to be true.

To illustrate the logical form of these arguments, we use letters of the alphabet (such as $p$, $q$, and $r$) to represent the component sentences and the expression “$\mathit{not}\ \ p$” to refer to the sentence “$\mathit{It\ is\ not\ the\ case\ that}\ \ p$.” Then the *common logical form* of both the previous arguments is as follows:
$$\displaylines{\text{If}\ \ p\ \text{or}\ q,\ \text{then}\ \ r\\\text{Therefore,\ if\ not}\ \ r,\ \text{then\ not}\ \ p\ \text{and\ not}\ \ q}$$

Examples: Fill in the blanks below so that argument (b) has the same form as argument (a). Then represent the common form of the arguments using letters to stand for component sentences.

> **a.** If Jane is a math major or Jane is a computer science major, then Jane will take Math 150.
> Jane is a computer science major.
> Therefore, Jane will take Math 150.
> &nbsp;
> **b.** If logic is easy or $\fbox{\ I (will) study hard \ }$, then $\fbox{\ I will get an A in this course \ }$.
> I will study hard.
> Therefore, I will get an A in this course
> $$\displaylines{\mathit{Common\ form:\ If\ }\ p\ or\ q,\ \ r.\\q.\\\text{Therefore,\ }\ r.}$$
