## Example 61.2: Application of the Equivalence between ∼p ∨ q and p → q
Rewrite the following statement in if-then form.
<center>Either you get to work on time or you are fired.</center>

**Solution:**
Let ∼p be
<center>You get to work on time.</center>

and q be
<center>You are fired.</center>

Then the given statement is ∼p ∨ q. Also p is
<center>You do not get to work on time.</center>

So the equivalent if-then version, p → q, is
<center>If you do not get to work on time, then you are fired.</center>
