## Example 62.1: Writing the Contrapositive
Write each of the following statements in its equivalent contrapositive form:
**a.** If Howard can swim across the lake, then Howard can swim to the island.
**b.** If today is Easter, then tomorrow is Monday.

**Solution:**
**a.** If Howard cannot swim to the island, then Howard cannot swim across the lake.
**b.** If tomorrow is not Monday, then today is not Easter.

When you are trying to solve certain problems, you may find that the contrapositive form of a conditional statement is easier to work with than the original statement. Replacing a statement by its contrapositive may give the extra push that helps you over the top in your search for a solution. This logical equivalence is also the basis for one of the most important laws of deduction, **modus tollens** (to be explained in Section 2.3), and for the **contrapositive method of proof** (to be explained in Section 4.6).
