## Variables
used as a placeholder when you want to talk about something but either:
(1) you imagine that it has one or more values but you don't know what they are;
(2) you want whatever you say about it to be equally true for all elements in a given set **e.g.**
> <center>Is there a  number with the following property: doubling it and adding 3 gives the same result as squaring it</center>
> 
> Is there a number $x$ with the property that $2x + 3 = x^2$?

<br>

**More examples** (Use variables to rewrite the following sentences more formally)

Are there numbers with with the property that the sum of their squares equals the square of their sum?
>[!CHECK|alt-co collapse ttl-c]
> Are there numbers $a$ and $b$ with the property that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2$?
> Are there numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2$?
> Do there exist any numbers $a$ and $b$ that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2$?

Given any real number, its square is nonnegative.
>[!CHECK|alt-co collapse ttl-c]
> Given any real number $r$, $r^2$ is nonnegative
> For any real number $r$, $r^2 \ge 0$
> For all real number $r$, $r^2 \ge 0$

**Universal statement** - says that a certain property is true for all elements in a set e.g., *All positive numbers are greater than zero*
- [[DISCRET12ch1universalconditional|Universal conditional]]
- [[DISCRET12ch1universalexistential|Universal existential]]

**Conditional statement** - says that if one thing is true then some other thing also has to be true e.g., *If 378 is divisible by 18. then 378 is divisible by 6*

**Existential statement** - says that there is at least one thing for which the property is true e.g., *There is a prime number that is even*
