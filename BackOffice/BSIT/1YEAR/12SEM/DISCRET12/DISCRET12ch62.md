## The Contrapositive of a Conditional Statement
One of the most fundamental laws of logic is the equivalence between a conditional statement and its contrapositive.

>[!INFO|alt-co collapse] DEFINITION
> The **contrapositive** of a conditional statement of the form “*If $p$ then $q$*” is
> &nbsp;
> <center>If ∼q then ∼p.</center>
> 
> &nbsp;
> Symbolically,
> <center>The contrapositive of p → q is ∼q → ∼p.</center>

The fact is that
> A conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.

#### The Converse and Inverse of a Conditional Statement
The fact that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent is very important and has wide application. Two other variants of a conditional statement are not logically equivalent to the statement.
