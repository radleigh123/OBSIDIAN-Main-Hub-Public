## Example 64.1: Interpreting Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
Consider the statement “*If John is eligible to vote, then he is at least 18 years old.*” The truth of the condition “*John is eligible to vote*” is sufficient to ensure the truth of the condition “*John is at least 18 years old*.” In addition, the condition “*John is at least 18 years old*” is necessary for the condition “*John is eligible to vote*” to be true. <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">If John were younger than 18, then he would not be eligible to vote</mark>.
