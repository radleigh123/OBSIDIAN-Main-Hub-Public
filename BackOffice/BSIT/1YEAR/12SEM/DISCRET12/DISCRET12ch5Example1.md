> There are two ways to show that statement forms $P$ and $Q$ are <mark class="hltr-lightred">not logically equivalent</mark>. As indicated previously, one is to use a truth table to find rows for which their truth values differ. The other way is to find concrete statements for each of the two forms, one of which is true and the other of which is false. The next example illustrates both of these ways.
