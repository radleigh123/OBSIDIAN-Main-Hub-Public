a statement that is existential because its first part asserts that a certain object exists and is universal because its second part says that the object satisfies a certain property for all things of a certain kind
**e.g.**

> ◾ There is a person $p$ in my class such that $p$ is as old as every person in my class
> ◾ There is a person $p$ in my class with the property that for every person $q$ in my class, $p$ is at least as old as $q$
