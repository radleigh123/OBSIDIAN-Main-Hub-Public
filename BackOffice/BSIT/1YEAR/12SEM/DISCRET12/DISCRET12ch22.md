## Cartesian Products
>- Given sets $A$ and $B$, the **Cartesian product of $A$ and $B$**
>	- $A \times B$ read "A cross B"
>	- is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b)
>		-  where $a$ is in $A$ and $b$ is in $B$
>
> $$A \times B = \{(a, b)\ |\ a \in A\ \ and\ \ b \in B \}$$

**More examples**
Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}\ \ and\ \ B = \{u, v\}$.

> ◾ $A \times B = \{(1,u), (2,u), (3,u), (1,v), (2,v), (3,v)\}$
> ◾ $B \times A = \{(u,1), (u,2), (u,3), (v,1), (v,2), (v,3)\}$
> ◾ $B \times B = \{(u,u), (u,v), (v,u), (v,v)\}$

> ◾ How many elements are in $A \times B$, $B \times A$, and $B \times B$?
> $A \times B$ has six elements. Note that this is the number of elements in $A$ times the number of elements in $B$. $B \times A$ has six elements, the number of elements in $B$ times the number of elements in $A$. $B \times B$ has four elements, the number of elements in $B$ times the number of elements in $B$

> ◾ Let $R$ denote the set of all real numbers. Describe $R \times R$
> $R \times R$ is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) where both $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. If horizontal and vertical axes are drawn on a plane and a unit length is marked off, then each ordered pair in $R \times R$ corresponds to a unique point in the plane, with the first and second elements of the pair indicating, respectively, the horizontal and vertical positions of the point.  The term **Cartesian plane** is often used to refer to a plane with this coordinate system, as illustrated below
