## Example 5.2: Showing Nonequivalence
Show that the statement forms $\lnot(p\ ∧\ q)$ and $\lnot p\ \ ∧ \lnot q$ are not logically equivalent.

> b. This method uses an example to show that $∼(p ∧ q)$ and $∼p ∧ ∼q$ are not logically equivalent. Let $p$ be the statement “**0 < 1**” and let $q$ be the statement “**1 < 0**.” Then
> $$∼(p\ ∧\ q)\quad \text{is “It is not the case that both 0 < 1 and 1 < 0,"}$$
> which is true. On the other hand,
> $$∼p\ \ ∧ ∼q\quad \text{is “0 ≮ 1 and 1 ≮ 0,"}$$
> which is **false**. This example shows that there are concrete statements you can substitute for $p$ and $q$ to make one of the statement forms true and the other false. Therefore, the statement forms are <mark class="hltr-lightred">not logically equivalent</mark>.
