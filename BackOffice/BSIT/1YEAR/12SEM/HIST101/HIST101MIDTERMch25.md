## Mactan Affairs
> With this **accidental** discovery of the Philippines, Magellan envisioned to present Cebu, and the rest of the islands he discovered to the Spanish King. But because these islands are quite small in land area, he would like to bring in more islands with <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Cebu as its capital</mark> and <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Rajah Humabon as its Head Chief</mark>.

**April 26, 1521** Mactan - **LapuLapu**
- LapuLapu came out in open defiance, when he prevented **Zula** (another Mactan Chief & friend of Humabon) from complying his quota as tribute for Magellan
- <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Battle of Mactan</mark>, Magellan did not give Zula his request, but <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">organized the raid w/ 60 men</mark>
- According to **Pigafetta**
	- they Mactan three hours before dawn
	- <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">forty-nine of them</mark> leaped into the water up to their thighs
	- other <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">eleven men</mark> remained behind
	- <mark class="hltr-lightred">enemies were three divisions, number of more than 1,500</mark>
	- we formed two divisions
	- Lapulapu's men hit him in the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">left leg</mark> w/ a powerful <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">long bolo</mark>
