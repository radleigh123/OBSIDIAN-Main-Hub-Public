### Excerpt from the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 or Bell Trade Act
Anticipating the eventual granting of independence to the Filipinos, a member of the US House of Representatives, Charles Jasper Bell of Missouri, filed a bill in September 1945 which aimed to govern the future trading relations between the US and the Philippines. This bill was later passed as a law and has since been known as the Philippine Trade Act or the Bell Trade Act of 1946. Some of the main provisions of the bill include
1) the fixed 2:1 exchange rug between the Philippine peso and the US dollar; 
2) the unlimited free trade between the Philippines and the US for the next eight years;
3) the gradual placing of tariffs on trade products until fall rates are achieved in 1974
4) and the granting of parity rights to the Americans. 
The fourth provision meant that American entities can tap resources which was reserved to the Filipinos as stated in the 1935 Philippine Constitution. Simply put, the Bell Trade Act compelled the Congress to amend the Constitution.
	The bill was received negatively by some critics for it was thought to tie the Philippines to the US economically even after the granting of independence. However, the US passed the bill as a complement to the Philippine Rehabilitation Act, which pledged a total of $620,000,000 ($120 million for the construction of public works, $400 million for individual damages, and $100 million in war surplus goods) as war reparations. However, the Rehabilitation Act provided that payments larger than $500 shall not be released unless the Philippines ratifies the Bell Trade Act first. This meant that the Philippines had to consent to both of the legislations in order to avail of the much needed war reparations. Through the Commonwealth Act 733 enacted on July 3, 1946, the Bell Trade Act was ratified by the Philippine Congress. An excerpts of the Act is found below.
