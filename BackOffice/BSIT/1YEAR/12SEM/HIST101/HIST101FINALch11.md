Photos of Manila After the War
The narratives about the ten-year transition period of the Philippines, as promised by the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, were unfortunately blemished by the atrocities of the war in the Pacific. As a next logical target of the Japanese Empire's expansionism which worked along the lines of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Philippines was ultimately dragged into the said worldwide conflict when Japanese forces invaded the Philippines hours after the destruction of Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
The next few years were some of the darkest in the archipelago's history-thousands of lives were lost; the economy was in bad shape; there was widespread famine; and the land was extensively damaged. It has been purported that Manila, next to the Polish capital of Warsaw, sustained the greatest physical destruction among the major theaters of the Second World War. The damage caused by the war to Manila, especially toward the end of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, had been well-documented in different photographs. Some of these are found below.
