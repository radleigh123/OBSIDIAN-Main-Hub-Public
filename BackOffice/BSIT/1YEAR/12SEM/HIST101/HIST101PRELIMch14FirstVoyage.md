## Excerpts from first voyage around the world by Antonio Pigafetta
Ferdinand Magellan was a Portuguese sailor who defected to Spain after his services to the Portuguese crown were not properly recognized. He had seen action in the far East when he participated in the capture of Malacca by the Portuguese forces in 1511. Turning to Spain, he managed to persuade King Charles V to furnish him with men and ships for an expedition that would discover a Western route to the East, a fear he would successfully accomplish. This would pave the way for Spanish intrusion into East Asia (primarily China) and the Pacific and the colonization of the archipelago. The chronicle of the famed expedition was aptly entitled First Voyage Around the World; its author was the Italian Antonio Pigafetta who took part in the said expedition. The ambitious expedition led by Magellan was composed of a fleet of five ships and around 250 men who were mostly Castilians. They started off from San Lucar, Spain, navigated through a strait located at the tip of the South American continent, and crossed the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. On March 16, 1521, after almost two years of hardship at sea, they saw the island of Samar in the eastern part of the country. They named the newly discovered territory Archipelago de San Lazaro because it was the feast day of the saint

At dawn on Saturday. March sixteen, 1521, we came upon a high land at a distance of three hundred leagues from the islands of Ladroni-an island named Zamal \[i.e., Samar]. On Monday afternoon, we saw a boat coming toward us with nine men in it. Therefore, the captain-general ordered that no one should move or say a word without his permission. When those men reached the shore, their chief went immediately to the captain-general, giving signs of joy because of our arrival. Five of the most ornately adorned of them remained with us, while the rest went to get some others who were fishing. and so, they all came. The captain-general, seeing that they were reasonable men, ordered food to be set forth before them, and gave them red caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory, bocasine, and other things. When they saw the captain's courtesy, they presented fish, a jar of palm wine which they call uraca (i.e., arrack], figs more than one palm long \[i.e., bananas), and others which were smaller and more delicate, and two cocoanuts.

Those people became very familiar with us. They told us many things, their names and those of some of the islands that could be seen from that place. Their own island was called Zuluan and it is not very large. We took great pleasure with them, for they were very pleasant and conversable. In order to show them greater honor, the captain-general took them to his ship and showed them all his merchandise-cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, gold and all things in the ship. He had some mortars fired for them, whereat they exhibited great fear, and tried to jump out of the ship. They made signs to us that the abovesaid articles grew in that place where we were going...The Island where we were is called Humunu; (now Homonhon) but inasmuch as we found two springs there of the clearest water, we called it Acquada da li buoni Segnialli \[i.e., \<the Watering-place of good Signs'), for there were the first signs of gold which we found in those districts...There are many islands in that district. and therefore, we called them the archipelago of San Lazaro, as they were discovered on the Sabbath of St Lazarus.

Magellan also met some local chiefs which whom he had a cordial relationship. Afterwards, on Easter Sunday, the first recorded mass in Philippine history, was held in a small island called <Mazaua." Interpretations of Pigafetta's account have differed as to the place of the first mass; whether it was the small island of Limasawa, south of Leyte or Butuan in northern Mindanao. However, scholars have presented evidences which tended to favor Limasawa over Butuan.

Pieces of gold, of the size of walnuts and eggs are found by sifting the earth in the island of that king who came to our ships. All the dishes of that king are of gold and also some portion of his house. as we were told by that king himself. According to their customs he was very grandly decked out \[molto in ordine], and the finest looking man that we saw among those people. His hair was exceedingly black, and hung to his shoulders. He had a covering of silk on his head, and wore two large golden earrings fastened in his ears. He wore a cotton cloth all embroidered with silk, which covered him from waist to knees. Al his side hung a dagger, the haft of which was somewhat long and all of gold, and its scabbard of carved wood. He had three spots of gold on every tooth, and his teeth appeared as if bound with gold. He was perfumed with storax and benzoin. He was tawny and painted \[i e., tattooed] all over. That island of his was called Butuan and Calagan. When those kings wished to see one another, they both went to hunt in that island where we were. The name of the first king is Raia Colambu, and the second Raia Siaui.

Early on the morning of Sunday, the last of March and Easter-day, the captain-general sent the priest with some men to prepare the place where mass was to be said, together with the interpreter to tell the king that we were not going to land in order to dine with him, but to say mass. Therefore, the king sent us two swine that he had killed. When the hour for mass arrived, we landed with about fifty men, without body armor, but carrying our other arms, and dressed in our best clothes. Before we reached the shore with our boat, six pieces were discharged as a sign of peace. We landed, the two kings embraced the captain-general, and placed him between them. We went in marching order to the place consecrated, which was not tar from the shore. Before the commencement of mass. the captain sprinkled the entire bodies of the two kings with musk water. During the mass we made our offerings. The kings went forward to kiss the cross as we did, but they did not offer their sacrifice. When the body of our Lord was elevated, they remained on their knees and worshipped Him with clasped hands. The ships fired all their artillery at once when the body of Christ was elevated, the signal having been given from the shore with muskets. Alter the conclusion of mass, some of our men took communion.

> During the 16th century, Cebu was a thriving commercial port ruled by Raja (a Sanskrit term, signifying outside influences) and was part of the Asian trade network.

The expedition then proceeded to the port of Cebu.' There they met Cebu's ruler, Raja Humabon, whom Magellan was able to convince to become a vassal of the King and a servant of Christ. Magellan, however, gets embroiled in a conflict between the two chiefs of Mactan, Zula and Lapu-lapu--which was eventually followed by a battle.

On Friday. April twenty-six. Zula, a chief of the island of Matan, sent one of his sons to present two goats to the captain-general, and to say that he would send him all that he had promised, but that he had not been able to send it to him because of the other chief, Cilapulapu, who refused to obey the king of Spain. He requested the captain to send him only one boatload of men on the next night so that they might help him fight against the other chief. The captain-general decided to go thither with three boatloads. We begged him repeatedly not to go, but he, like a good shepherd, refused to abandon his flock. At midnight, sixty of us set out armed with corselets and helmets, together with the Christian king, the prince, some of the chief men, and twenty or thirty balanguais. We reached Matan three hours before dawn. The captain did not wish to fight them, but sent a message to the natives by the Muslim to the effect that if they would obey the king of Spagnia, recognize the Christian king as their sovereign. and pay us our tribute, he would be their friend; but that if they wished otherwise, they should wait to see how our lances wounded They replied that if we had lances, they had lances of bamboo and stakes hardened with fire. \[They asked us] not to proceed to attack them at once, but to wait until morning, so that they might have more men They said that in order to induce us to go in search of them; for they had dug certain pit holes between the houses in order that we might fall into them. When morning came, forty-nine of us leaped into the water up to our thighs, and walked through water for more than two crossbow flights before we could reach the shore. The boats could not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water. The other eleven men remained behind to guard the boats. When we reached land, those men had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand five hundred persons When they saw us, they charged down upon us with exceeding loud cries, two divisions on our flanks and the other on our front. When the captain saw that, he formed us into two divisions, and thus did we begin to fight. The musketeers and crossbowmen shot from a distance for about half an hour, but uselessly; for the shots only passes through the shields which were made of thin wood, and the arms \[of the bearers]. The captain cried to them, "Cease firing Cease firing!' but his order was not heeded at all. When the natives saw that we were shooting our muskets to no purpose, crying out they \[were] determined to stand firm, and redoubled their shouts. When our muskets were discharged, the natives would never stand still, but leaped hither and thither, covering themselves with their shields. They shot so many arrows at us and hurled so many bamboo spears (some of them tipped with iron) at the captain-general, besides pointed stakes hardened with fire, stones, and mud, that we could scarcely defend ourselves. Seeing that, the captain-general sent some men to burn their houses in order to terrify them When they saw their houses burning, they were roused to greater fury Two of our men were killed near the houses, while we burned twenty or thirty houses. So many of them charged down upon us that they shot the captain through the right leg with a poisoned arrow. On that account, he ordered us to retire slowly, but the men look lo light, except six or eight of us who remained with the captain. The natives shot only at our legs, for the latter were bare; and so many were the spears and stones that they hurled at us that we could offer no resistance. The mortars in the boats could not aid us as they were too far away So we continued to retire for more than a good crossbow flight from the shore, always fighting up to our knees in the water. The natives continued to pursue us and picking up the same spear four or six times. hurled it at us again and again. Recognizing the captain, so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice, but he always stood firm like a good knight, together with some others.

Thus did we fight for more than one hour, refusing to retire farther. An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain's face, but the latter immediately killed him with his lance, which he left in the Indian's body. Then, trying to lay hand on sword, he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear. When the natives saw that, they all hurled themselves upon him. One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass, which resembled a scimitar, only being larger. That caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses, until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide. When they wounded him, he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats. Thereupon, beholding him dead, we, wounded, retreated, as best we could, to the boats, which were already pulling off.

After Magellan's demise, the remaining members of the expedition tried to make their
way back to Spain but only the little ship Victoria commanded by Sebastian del Cano
was able to return safely. The eighteen survivors arrived in Seville in 1522, completing
the first continuous circumnavigation of the world. Several expeditions were sent by
Spain in the next four decades in order to establish their claims over the Moluccas and
each one of them made a stop in the Philippine islands. One expedition led by Ruy
de Villalobos gave the islands the name Las Phelipinas in honor of the Spanish crown
prince Philip II.

The map shows the route taken by the Magellan expedition (1519-1522) in what is considered the first circumnavigation of the world. The three-year journey started in the southern port of San Lucar, Spain in 1519 with five ships commanded by Ferdinand Magellan. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean and followed the coast of South America in order to locate a passageway through the continent, a narrow strait which was eventually named after Magellan. The expedition then crossed the unexpectedly vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean and encountered land first at Ladroni Island and from there to Samar Island in central Philippines. Magellan was killed by the natives in the Battle of Mactan near Cebu and so the expedition was continued under the leadership of Sebastian del Cano who skillfully guided the party through the Moluocas or Spice Islands, the Indian Ocean, the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa, the Atlantic Ocean and finally back to Spain in 1522.

This is a portrait of King Philip Il of Spain painted by the Venetian artist Titian in 1550. Philip II was the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and he ruled over the Spanish Empire from 1556 to 1598 during which it attained the peak of its power. The description, "the empire where the sun never sets," was used during his time as he ruled territories from Madrid, the imperial capital, to the other side of the globe in Manila, the colonial capital of the Philippines which was named in his honor.
