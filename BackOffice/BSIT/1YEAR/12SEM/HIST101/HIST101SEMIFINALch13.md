## Excerpt from Monastic Supremacy in the Philippines
The <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">lawyer</mark> and the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">propagandist</mark> par excellence, **Marcelo H. Del Pilar**, famously known as **Plaridel**, was born on **August 30, 1850** in the **barrio of Kupang** in the town of **Bulakan, Bulacan**. He acquired his law degree from the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">University of Santo Tomas</mark> in **1880**. Del Pilar concerned himself with igniting the patriotic sentiments of his countrymen and attacking the abuses of the friars by going around the provinces and seizing every chance to speak in public places. He also penned pamphlets such as “*<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Caiigat kayo</mark>*” (**Be as slippery as eel**) which defended Rizal’s _Noli Me Tangere_ , and wrote _**Dasalan at Tocsohan**_ , a<mark class="hltr-lightgreen"> mock prayer book which criticized the friars</mark>. He was also instrumental in the founding of _<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Diariong tagalog</mark>_ in **1882**, the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">first bilingual newspaper in Spanish and Tagalog</mark>. In **1888**, he escaped to Spain in order to <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">prevent his arrest due to his subversive activities</mark>. The following year, he published _**La soberania monacal en Filipinas Monastic Supremacy in the Philippines**_ and "***La frailocracia Filipina***”, works which <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">analyzed and denounced friar influence over the colony</mark>. In Spain, <mark class="hltr-lightblue">Del Pilar organized Filipinos and led the Propaganda Movement</mark>. He exerted all his physical and intellectual energies and resorted to his political connections to ensure the success of the campaign. He was, at one time, <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">editor of the _Sol_</mark> , an <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">officer of the Hispano-Filipino Association</mark>, and a high-ranking mason. In 1896, he went to Barcelona to board a ship to return to his beloved country but in a few months, is health collapsed. He <mark class="hltr-lightred">died of tuberculosis on July 4, 1896</mark>.

**Primary Source**
The interference of the friars in the government of the Philippines is so ingrained that without difficulty the friars control the status quo of the country in defiance of the nation and the institutions.

In charge at almost all the parishes their parochial mission takes on the double character of a political organ and popular patronage.

This <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">mission</mark> gives the curate great power in each locality, and this power, as it does not lose its monastic power, as it does not lose its monastic character, is at the command of the regular prelates under whose guidance the parish priests think, preach, confess, and act with marvelous uniformity.

<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">To frighten the government</mark> with the rebelliousness of the country, and frighten the country with the despotism of the government that is <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">the system that the friars have so skillfully evolved in order to be able to rule at the expense of every one.</mark>

They offer the government to suppress the country's rebelliousness and the government gives them all its <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">autocratic support</mark>, going to the extreme if the friars so demand, while they portray the ruler as the personification of tyranny and despotism.

They <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">offer</mark> the people <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">to soften that tyranny</mark> and the people places its wealth in their hands so that they may defend them against official rapacity.

Having scant resources, the government exposes its nakedness. Neither can it restore the residence of the highest official of the Islands nor build bridges or schools, nor satisfy its most pressing needs; while the convents, for each curate of their corporation, in each locality with three thousand souls, display luxurious palaces and all the manifestations of pomp.

The <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">basis of monastic wealth</mark> is the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">lack of union between the people and the government</mark> and so it is necessary to foster it by fanning and resentment of the first and the despotism of the second.

To achieve this, they count on the diversity of languages among the rulers and the ruled; and to preserve that diversity to impede popular education, and to avoid at any cost that the people and the government come to understand each other, are the best way of keeping them in perpetual antagonism.

In the performance of their duties, the municipal officials depend on the parish priest.
To report on the conduct of a citizen the testimony of one hundred members of the principalia is not enough. The essential requirement is the curate's approval. The signature of the curate is necessary to the census of residents in a municipality; to the conscription of eligible young men, to formalize accounts and other official documents; to everything and for everything the curate's signature is an essential requisite...

The **gobernadorcillo** is the only official required to obtain the indispensable parish approval for his acts. If the curate refuses to give it, the official is liable to be reprimanded by his chiefs.
Numerous are the duties of the municipal official in the Philippines. Besides his judicial functions, he performs administrative duties pertaining to finance, mail, and others. Considering his dependence on the friar curate, it is not surprising that the curate should direct the official correspondence, retaining in fact the power of **exequatur**.

Public education is one of the common aspirations of both the government and the Filipinos. The government as well as the people dream of a common language in the Islands. The government wants to understand the people and to be understood by them. The people want the government to know and remedy their needs without the mediation of other elements.

But <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">monasticism</mark> is opposed to this, because it fears that the country may become Hispanized and cease to be a monastic colony.

There is a normal school in Manila where teachers are trained for the diffusion in the towns in of primary education and the teaching of the Spanish language. Competent young men who have graduated from it prove the zeal and the efforts of the government and of the Jesuit fathers towards the realization of that ideal. But everything is shattered in the face of friar opposition.

The exception are the schools in the districts of Manila maintained by the municipal government of Manila. All the schools in the Archipelago are under the exclusive control of the curates. Their approval is an essential requisite for the teachers to get their salaries; their report on the teaching staff is final in government circles; hence the absolute dependence of teachers on the curate who positively prohibits the teaching of Spanish....

In accordance with the idea, **law 5, title 3, book I** of the **Laws of the Indies** and, **article 93** of the Ordinance of Good Government of **February 26, 1768**, the Educational Decree of **December 20, 1863**, and numerous other orders prescribe practical measures for the diffusion of the official language. declare those who obstruct it enemies of the mother country, and order repeatedly the use of textbooks in Spanish and in general prohibit those in Philippine languages.

The Superior Decree of **September 12,  1883** bearing on this matter provides the following:
- **Article 4** Textbooks shall be written in the official language, allowing the use of those in the native dialects only in cases where they are absolutely necessary for the teaching of pupils who do not understand it until they learn it.

In corroboration of this **Fr. Miguel Lucio Bustamante**, a <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Franciscan friar</mark>, published a short story in Tagalog entitled *<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Si Tandang Bacio Macunat</mark>*. In this he attacked the study of Spanish and other subjects; he dissuades the fathers of families from desiring education for their children, laying down the dogma that the moment the Indio separated from his carabao, he becomes a traitor to God and to his king.

For that reason, we don’t believe we are mistaken in saying that the purpose of the government is defeated by entrusting to the friars the promotion of education.

The personal security of the citizens is equally endangered by monastic power. **Law 7, title IV, book III** of the Laws of the Indies grants to the governor general the power to remove from their domicile the citizens who disturb their provinces. With this power as a pretext, under the governors who allowed themselves to be led by the friars, deportations without trial increased, and panic spread among the people of the Philippines...

To exile a citizen without previous hearing, without hearing his side, to reject a priori his defense, without informing him of the reason for the imposition of so grave a penalty that upsets his way to life, to tear him off from his home without explanations, to kill his happiness and that of his family condemning them to indefinite nostalgia – these are measures which can be upheld only by one who ignores the family institutions and bases his rule on a policy of terrorism.

Certainly this is preferred by the friars in their eagerness to separate the people and the government. When monasticism predominates in the council of the governor general, measures of this kind are promulgated and circulars are sent to the regular curates similar to what we have read as follows:
- The Governor General has recently decided that for greater social security, it is advisable to remove from the towns, persons whose behavior is not in accord with the same morality, principles, and institutions and who set a bad example to good and respectable citizens and incite the natives to become enemies of the mother country....
- No one but the reverend parish curates can assist the government to carry out such meritorious work
- Their great knowledge of the citizens and the sacred character with which they are invested are more than enough guarantee that the individuals whom they indicate as undesirable because of their bad customs in their respective localities deserve the punishment of being expelled without making the official who ordered it being called <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">arbitrary</mark>. 

No one indeed is more suitable for such espionage as those who have means to discover the innermost secrets of private life. The regular curates by accepting without blushing the duties that convert them into government policemen give clear and obvious proof of their readiness to debate their vows, their mission of peace and of mercy that they swore before God when they received holy orders. Is the government sure of the sincerity of such assistants? ls it sure that they will not also debase their commission?

We don't know. But of those who go on exile the majority are those who don't kiss the curate’s hand, who cannot pay their debts to the friar, who are the fathers or husbands of unattainable beauties The danger to national integrity is the friars' hobby of imposing their preponderance in the Philippines. Does such a peril really exist’? Is the Government sufficient to avert It? Is it true that the Spanish Government would perish without friar support?

But the matter of imperiled national integrity before us deserves thorough examination and it is unwise to leave it to the colleagues or successors of **Fr. Gaspar de San Agustin** tor their exclusive comment. It is necessary to elucidate it with more prudence for on its correct appreciation depends in large measure the development of our colonial policy, which is not alien to international politics.

At the outset there is no serious proof that the Philippines intends to separate from Spain. Since **1837** she has been deprived of a most important right affecting her political vitality and her resignation for half a century was never altered by any kind of preterition.

<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Emancipation from Spain</mark> is against the growing progress of the Filipino people. As the archipelago consists of numerous islands, it needs a bond that will unite it to invigorate all the factors of its prosperity and welfare. Without this bond its division is imminent; from division to internal strife and from internal strife to international strife, there is only one step The Filipinos do not ignore any of these realities. Surrounded by countries with whom they have not least common principles, exposed continually to foreign rapacity, which lies in wait.
