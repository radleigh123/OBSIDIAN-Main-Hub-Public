## Church - Stake Partnership
> The establishment of the Spanish empire was attained through a remarkably close alliance between the secular and the religious authorites

Under the unique privilege known as **Patronato Real**, the Spanish King was granted by the pope the right to:
1. Present suitable priests for appointment to curacies, benefices, and other church offices
2. Intervene in the affairs of ecclesiastical government
3. Mediate conflicts between clergymen for the maintenance of peace and order
4. Disregard or suspend papal decrees or bulls within his domain

**The reason behind why the Pope gave the Spanish King such power:**
Spain has majorly contributed the propagation of Christianity, such responsibility was given to the papacy which was an immense responsibility. A responsibility the Spaniards were very much willing to undertake.
