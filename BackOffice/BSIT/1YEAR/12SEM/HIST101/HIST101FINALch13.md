### Excerpt from 1947 Military Bases Agreement
As explicitly stated in the Treaty of Manila of 1946, the US intended to continue to use the Philippines for its military operations in the Pacific. This was openly expressed by the US government despite granting independence to the Filipinos the previous year. While public disclosure on an agreement pertinent to US bases was only made in 1947, it must be noted that negotiations for the continental presence of Americans banned in the Philippines started in 1943, when the Commonwealth government was in exile in Washington. Many believed that the preservation of US bases in the country, as well as the granting of parity rights to the Americans, was inconsistent with the idea of independence. Nevertheless, arguing along the lines of peace, mutual defense, and military cooperation, the Philippines under Roxas, allowed the US to maintain military bases in the country by signing the Agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines Concerning Military Bases also known as the 1947 Military Bases Agreement. An excerpt of the agreement follows.
