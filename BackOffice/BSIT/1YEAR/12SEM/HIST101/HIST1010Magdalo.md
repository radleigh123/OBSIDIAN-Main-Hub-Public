**Magdalo** (faction)

was a faction of the Katipunan (a Philippine revolutionary organization with the aim to gain independence from Spain during the [[HIST101PhilippineRevolution|Philippine Revolution]]) chapter in Cavite.

It was named after **Mary Magdalene**, patroness of Kawit, Cavite. It was officially led by Baldomero Aguinaldo, but his cousin Emilio Aguinaldo (whose own Katipunan codename was "*Magdalo*") was its most famous leader.

The *Magdalo* had a rivalry with the other Katipunan chapter in Cavite, the [[HIST101Magdiwang|Magdiwang]] (both factions are terminologies for feasts: <mark class="hltr-lightblue">"dalo" in Tagalog means to attend, diwang means to celebrate</mark>). When the Manila-based Katipunan leader Andres Bonifacio went to Cavite to mediate between them, the *Magdalo* argued for the replacement of the Katipunan by a revolutionary government. The Magdiwang initially backed Bonifacio's stance that the Katipunan already served as their government, but at the [[HIST101TejerosConvention|Tejeros Convention]], both factions were combined into one government body under Emilio Aguinaldo who was elected as the president.

Some of the civil and military officials of the First Philippine Republic came from this group.
