## Reasons of the Failure of Early Revolts
1. There was no sense of unity and nationalism
2. The absence of national leaders
3. There was no training and preparations for warfare
4. Filipinos are more loyal to the Spaniards. So they helped the Spaniards than their fellow Filipinos
5. Lacking of superior arms and weapons
6. The uprising were more localized and random, thus the revolts were easily defeated by the more superior and organized Spanish forces
7. The Spanish policy *divide et impera* proved to be advantageous for the Spaniards because it developed animosity among the natives

The revolt was a failure in general, but it has one advantage. They taught the later generations of Filipinos the importance of unity. It is also in this context that they saw the failure of each revolt is a step in their political awakening. <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Each local revolt was a milestone to the road of national consciousness</mark>.
