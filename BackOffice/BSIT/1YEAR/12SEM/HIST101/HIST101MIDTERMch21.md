## Factors Which Lead to European Explorations in the East
The <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">16th century was the period of accidental discoveries</mark> and territorial expansion of European nations. The growing strength of the nation-states such as **Portugal**, **Spain**, **England**, and **France** together with the expansion of commerce and industry encourage European powers to expand their territories in the New World and in the East.

In the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">1600s, the East was still a mystery to Europeans</mark>. Although there was trade between Asia and Europe, fabulous Oriental goods such as Chinese silk and spices from Malaysia reach Europe indirectly through several caravan and sea routes, Europe's desires to reach Asia and monopolize trade was intensified by several factors.

1. The Europeans were inspired to go to the East because of the wondrous tales told by the [[HIST101MIDTERMch21Crusaders|Crusaders]] and [[HIST101MIDTERMch21MarcoPolo|Marco Polo]]
2. The Revival of learning in Europe called **Renaissance** led to inventions of navigation instruments, encouraging explorers to travel. Some of these inventions were the **[[HIST101MIDTERMch21Compass|compass]]**, the **[[HIST101MIDTERMch21Astrolabe|astrolabe]]**, and the **[[HIST101MIDTERMch21Portolan|portolan]]**.
3. The Fall of Constantinople in 1453, gave the Muslims Turks full control of the trade routes going to the East. This forced the European to look for new trade routes
