## Excerpt from La Solidaridad
>[!aside|right]+
> Gomburza Priests - **Mariano Gomez**, **Jose Burgos** and **Jacinto Zamora** were <u>leaders of the secularization movement which called for equality between Filipino secular priests and Spanish regular friars</u>

$\quad$Established in **1889**, the bimonthly newspaper _**La Solidaridad**_ was the<mark class="hltr-lightgreen"> official mouthpiece of the Propaganda Movement</mark>, the voice of the Filipinos in Spain. It was organized in Barcelona with **Graciano Lopez Jaena** as its <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">first editor</mark> followed by **Marcelo H. Del Pilar** when the publication moved to Madrid, the Spanish Capital. Del Pilar and Mariano Ponce were <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">the moving force</mark> behind the newspaper as they struggled to keep the publication going. _La Solidaridad_ or _Sol_ , as the propagandists fondly called it, published reports and scholarly works about the Philippines, polemical articles, and essays on European politics. Its <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">role</mark> in the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">political campaign</mark> reforms was <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">invaluable</mark> because it was through the _Sol_ that the Filipinos publicized their cause and rallied support from the Spanish public. Copies of the newspaper were also smuggled to the Philippines through Hong Kong by Jose Ma. Basa. The writer of the newspaper either signed their real names or adopted *pen names* such as **Dimasalang** and **Laong Laan** (Jose Rizal), **Plaridel** (Marcelo H. Del Pilar); **Taga-Ilog** (Antonio Luna); and **Naning**, **Kalipulako**, and **Tikbalang** (Mariano Ponce) Another major contributor to the newspaper was <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">the Austrian scholar Ferdinand Blumentritt</mark>. In **1895**, the _**Sol**_ was <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">forced to close up</mark> because of <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">insufficiency of funds</mark>.

La Solidaridad
Democratic Fortnightly
Barcelona, February 18, 1880
Year 1, No. 1
Modest very modest indeed are our aspirations. Our <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">program</mark> aside from being harmless is very simple <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">to fight at reaction to hinder all steps backward, to applaud and to accept all liberal ideas, and to defend progress in brief, to be a propagandist above all of ideals of democracy</mark> so that these might reign over all nations here and beyond the seas.

The <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">aims</mark> therefore of La Solidaridad are defined <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">to gather to collect liberal ideas which are daily exposed</mark> in the camp of politics, in the fields of science, arts, letters, commerce, agriculture, and industry. We shall also discuss all problems which deal with the general interest of the nation, socking solutions that are purely national and democratic.

The Spanish overseas provinces will find in La Solidaridad a zealous supporter of their just and lawful aspirations, an organ which will expose the evils which afflict those faraway places so that these conditions may be remedied....

It will expose fearlessly and dispassionately the disease that corrupts those societies, al phase of corruption which undermine justice and retard the economic development of our precious Antilles whose present state and whose future are concern of all parties and administrators.

Its political program therefore with respect to the colonies is not limited to any particular field not
any school of thought.

We shall pay special attention to the Philippines because those islands need the most help having been deprived of representation in the Cortes. We shall thus fulfill our patriotic duty in the defense of democracy in these islands.

That nation of eight million souls should not and must not be exclusive patrimony of theocracy and
conservatism.

In the beginning of our constitutional period, the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Philippine Archipelago</mark> was represented in our Cortes. Her voice was heard. She was consulted in the formation of the fundamental law of the state in **1812**. But in **1837** she was dispossessed of this national right which was taken from her with the pretext that it was being done for the good of the people and the country's welfare.

From then on, <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">all political parties</mark> seem tacitly agreed <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">to ignore, to forget to be indifferent to our overseas possessions</mark>. And if the need to study and effect remedies to evils which affect our home country to its very core should come up, everyone enjoins caution because the belief is that the evil is so deep-rooted that it is past cure.

Other nations employ different procedures. The British press and that beyond the **Pyrenees** lavish praise on the development of the natural resources of their possessions. Spain on the other hand sleeps and lets foreigners develop all her agricultural industrial, and commercial interests-all except monastic interest.

Indifference to our Archipelago will not be good for Spain's integrity in the Philippines. The county is attuned to progress. The heart of the nation longs for legitimate hopes of a better life and we do not believe in any political theory which would discuss such pleas with the classic "We shall see." We <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">believe</mark> therefore that <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">by offering to study the problems</mark> mentioned above and those relating to them, we shall be in our humble way of service to the nation and her institutions.
