# The Philippines Becomes A Spanish Colony
**<center>[[HIST101PRELIMch14Timeline|Timeline]]</center>**

During the <mark class="hltr-blue">fifteenth and sixteenth centuries</mark>, <mark class="hltr-blue">Europe</mark> saw an <mark class="hltr-blue">age of exploration and expansion</mark> brought about by various factors. First, there was the economic motive of finding a direct access to the profitable Oriental trade of luxury goods such as silk and spices. After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, commercial routes to the East fell under the control of Muslim traders who, along with the Italian city-state of Venice, monopolized the supply of highly prized Oriental products to Europe. Attempts were made by <mark class="hltr-blue">European monarchs</mark> and merchants to <mark class="hltr-blue">break the monopoly</mark> by sending <mark class="hltr-blue">voyages of exploration to discover alternative routes to the East</mark>. Second, <mark class="hltr-blue">scientific and technological progress specifically in shipbuilding</mark>, cartography, and navigational instruments significantly contributed to the success of the exploratory expeditions. This trend was exemplified by the efforts of the Portuguese Prince Henry who established a navigational school that gathered together scholars and sailors from all over the Mediterranean. Third, the <mark class="hltr-blue">quest to explore unknown and distant lands also involved the religious mission of spreading the Christian faith</mark>. Spain and Portugal maintained an anti-Muslim attitude emanating from the recent Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula against the Muslim Moors and a religious zeal to convert the peoples of Asia and Africa.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Portugal</mark> and <mark class="hltr-blue">Spain</mark> initially led the navigational race to the East. <mark class="hltr-blue">Portuguese</mark> sailors explored the coast of the African continent and in 1498, Vasco da Gama successfully reached India by rounding the <mark class="hltr-blue">Cape of Good Hope</mark> and sailing to the Indian Ocean. The port of Malacca, an important Southeast Asian entrep√¥t, was captured by the Portuguese in 1511. Meanwhile, the Italian sailor Christopher Columbus was able to convince the Spanish crown that he can reach the East through a Western route. In this attempt, he unsuspectingly reached the enormous American continent. These expeditions inevitably led to the acquisition of colonial territories and the founding of new settlements. Spain was able to build a vast empire over the American continent after having defeated the native Aztecs and Mayas. In 1519, the Portuguese sailor by the name of Ferdinand Magellan would try to fulfill Columbus' promise of reaching the East by sailing West. He would anchor on Philippine shores on the other side of the globe two years later; thus, marking the beginning of Spanish presence and influence on the archipelago. The Philippines was part of the Spanish empire for more than three centuries. During this long period native societies (especially in Luzon and Visayas) underwent a great transformation; the islands were named <mark class="hltr-blue">Las Phelipinas by Spanish voyagers</mark>; the population was organized into <mark class="hltr-blue">pueblos/towns</mark>; pagan practices were suppressed and Catholic Christianity was introduced; and a central government was established in the colonial capital of Manila. This chapter goes back to the beginning of Spanish conquest and colonization of the Philippine archipelago by presenting and analyzing primary sources.

>[!DONE]+ Chapter Summary
>- European exploration and expansion were driven by the search for access to the profitable Oriental trade, the religious mission of spreading Christianity and was made possible by the technological advances in navigation.
>
>- The Spaniards had three main aims in taking over the Philippine islands, namely, the expansion of trade, the conversion of the natives to Catholicism, and the extension of territories ruled by the King of Spain.
>- The subjugation of the native population mainly in the lowlands and coastal areas of Luzon and Visayas was affected through a combination of local alliances, military intrusion, and religious persuasion.
>- In 1571, Manila became the center of Spanish colonial power in the Philippines. Strategically located in the heart of the economically productive and thickly populated Tagalog and Kapampangan regions in Luzon, the city grew to become the paramount city of the archipelago.
