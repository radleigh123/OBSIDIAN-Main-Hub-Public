## The Revolt and its reasons
The Spanish colonial policy was virtually designed not only to keep the Philippines under complete control but <mark class="hltr-lightblue">also to exploit her rich natural resources</mark>. The Spanish unjust economic and administrative policies made Filipinos everyday life miserable. It developed an intense motive among the inhabitants to resist and rebel against the ruling conquerors. And because these abuses were unbearable, it led people to revolt.

The following are the causes of early revolts:
1. Loss of power statue and influence of the native chieftains
2. Loss of power of the local priests who controlled the craft of magic and idolatry to Christian missionaries
3. Intolerable conditions on agrarian and land tenure
4. Excessive and [[onerous]] system of taxation
5. Forced labor
6. Malpractices of Spanish government officials in the bureaucracy, resulting to massive graft and corruption
7. Racial Prejudice
8. Misadministration of justice
9. Abuses, viciousness, and immortality of friars
10. Religious freedom
11. Denial of human rights
