As one of the main provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, a transition government called the **Commonwealth** was established in the Philippines. Its main goal was to get the Filipinos ready for complete independence from the US and for self-rule. The Filipinos' desire for independence, first echoed in 1892 through the revolutionary society called the Katipunan, was finally within reach. This process toward self-governance, however, was rudely interrupted in 1941 by the empire of Japan which had been notoriously expanding in different East Asian territories since the 1930s. Under the guise of economic cooperation and shared prosperity, the Japanese eventually entered Philippine skies and shores on December 1941 after their surprise assault against the US Armed Forces in Pearl Harbor. Hostilities between the Japanese against the Filipinos and their American allies then ensued in various points of the archipelago. **Pres. Manuel L. Quezon**, together with other high-ranking officials of his US-sponsored government, were forced to move out of the Philippines. and to establish a government-in-exile, first in Australia and then in Washington. Meanwhile, after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor to the forces of General Masaharu Homma, General Douglas MacArthur had left the Philippines for Australia in March 1942 via Mindanao. It was also in Austria that MacArthur, the military advisor to the Commonwealth government, was quoted saying, "I came through and I shall return."

MacArthur's pledge, which sparked some hope among Filipinos amidst Japanese violence for the next three years, was finally fulfilled on October 20, 1944 when his forces landed in Leyte, liberating the Philippines from the Japanese. The following weeks and months witnessed American and Filipino victories all over the archipelago. Provinces in the Visayas, then in Luzon, were secured one by one. After a destructive and bloody campaign against the Japanese, Manila was liberated on March 3, 1945, then the entire Philippines on July 5, 1945. Outside the Philippines, Japanese forces were also on the retreat. Japan announced its surrender, through Emperor Hirohito himself, in a radio broadcast in August of the same year before being formally recognized by other belligerent parties on September 2, 1945. This surrender took place in the US Warship Missouri while docked at Tokyo Bay. The war in the Pacific was finally over.'

Back in the Philippines, the long-standing quest for independence also resumed. The Malacañan Palace was turned over to the Commonwealth government with Sergio Osmeña as the president. The Congress was once again able to convene and called for a general election on April 23, 1946. This particular race was won by Manuel Roxas, the third and final head of the Commonwealth and first for the Third Philippine Republic. Independence was finally proclaimed on July 4, 1946.

However, this feat came at a very unlikely, if not unfavorable time. The country was profoundly destroyed, both in the physical and the emotional sense. Buildings, houses, and other public works had been reduced to rubble while thousands of lives were prematurely ended by the war and its atrocities. Families were broken and a collective trauma among the populace was rather apparent. The enthusiasm for self-rule was replaced by anxiety caused by an uncertain future for the country. With a nation extensively damaged, where would rebuilding begin? How would the deep wounds inflicted by the war heal? Should the alleged war crime perpetrators and collaborators be punished or forgiven?

Such questions were probably the ones Filipinos had to confront during the early years of the postwar period. In this chapter, with the use of primary sources, the following will be discussed: the declaration of independence, the process of rehabilitation of the Philippines, and some of its other then-pressing concerns such as the damaged economy, the issue of US military bases in the islands, and the controversial collaboration issue with the Japanese. Some of the sources included are the Treaty of Manila of 1946, photos of postwar Philippines, the Bell Trade Act, the Military Bases Agreement of 1947, and the text of the amnesty provided by President Roxas to Filipinos charged with treasonable collaboration with the Japanese.

## Chapter Summary
- Philippine independence from the US was formally recognized after the Treaty of Manila had been signed on July 6, 1946. While this could be considered a feat for the Filipinos and an absolute watershed in the history of the country, independence came at an extremely troubled time. Fresh from the war, the Philippines was extremely destroyed. Thousands of lives had been lost; public works had been rendered inutile; and the country was plagued by the issue of collaboration.
- The country also had to confront issues pertinent to its relations with the US. With its heavy losses from the war, the US tried to continue utilizing the Philippines in various ways to the former's advantages. Economically, the Philippines was tied to US as seen in the provisions of the Bell Trade Act. Likewise, the armed forces of the US continued to have the military presence in Philippine soil through the 1947 Military Bases Agreement.
- The collaboration issue was resolved by the granting of amnesty by Pres. Manuel Roxas.
