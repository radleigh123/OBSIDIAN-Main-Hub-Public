**Magdiwang** (faction)

was a chapter of the Katipunan, a Philippine revolutionary organization founded by Filipino rebels in Manila in 1892, with the aim to gain independence from Spain. The Magdiwang Council was acknowledged "*as the supreme organ responsible for the successful campaigns against the enemy*" within Cavite.

The Magdiwang chapter was started by **Mariano Álvarez**, related by marriage to Andrés Bonifacio, the leader of the Katipunan. Both the *Magdiwang* and the *[[HIST1010Magdalo|Magdalo]]* (led by Baldomero Aguinaldo, the cousin of Emilio Aguinaldo) were the two major Katipunan factions in Cavite, with the *Magdiwang* having control over a larger number of towns and municipalities.

When rivalry grew between the two factions, Bonifacio was invited to mediate, but he was quickly embroiled in discussions with the Magdalo, who wished to replace the Katipunan with an insurgent government. The Magdiwang initially backed Bonifacio's stance that the Katipunan already served as their government, but at the Tejeros Convention, both factions were combined into one government body under Aguinaldo.
