> The battle for the liberation of Manila from the Japanese rule was waged from February 3, 1945 to March 3, 1945 considered to be one of the greatest tragedies of World War II and was a turning point in the development of Philippine society More than 100,000 men, women and children died over the course of the Battle of Manila Homes, buildings and architectural works were also reduced to rubble. The photo of the destroyed Walled City of Intramuros shows the extent of the damage sustained by the City of Manila as Philippine and American troops fought against the Imperial Japanese forces.

# Independence and the Establishment of a New Republic

<center><strong>The Battle of Manila</strong></center>

As one of the main provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, a transition government called the **Commonwealth** was established in the Philippines. Its main goal was to get the Filipinos ready for complete independence from the US and for self-rule. The Filipinos' desire for independence, first echoed in 1892 through the revolutionary society called the Katipunan, was finally within reach. This process toward self-governance, however, was rudely interrupted in 1941 by the empire of Japan which had been notoriously expanding in different East Asian territories since the 1930s. Under the guise of economic cooperation and shared prosperity, the Japanese eventually entered Philippine skies and shores on December 1941 after their surprise assault against the US Armed Forces in Pearl Harbor. Hostilities between the Japanese against the Filipinos and their American allies then ensued in various points of the archipelago. **Pres. Manuel L. Quezon**, together with other high-ranking officials of his US-sponsored government, were forced to move out of the Philippines. and to establish a government-in-exile, first in Australia and then in Washington. Meanwhile, after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor to the forces of General Masaharu Homma, General Douglas MacArthur had left the Philippines for Australia in March 1942 via Mindanao. It was also in Austria that MacArthur, the military advisor to the Commonwealth government, was quoted saying, "I came through and I shall return."

MacArthur's pledge, which sparked some hope among Filipinos amidst Japanese violence for the next three years, was finally fulfilled on October 20, 1944 when his forces landed in Leyte, liberating the Philippines from the Japanese. The following weeks and months witnessed American and Filipino victories all over the archipelago. Provinces in the Visayas, then in Luzon, were secured one by one. After a destructive and bloody campaign against the Japanese, Manila was liberated on March 3, 1945, then the entire Philippines on July 5, 1945. Outside the Philippines, Japanese forces were also on the retreat. Japan announced its surrender, through Emperor Hirohito himself, in a radio broadcast in August of the same year before being formally recognized by other belligerent parties on September 2, 1945. This surrender took place in the US Warship Missouri while docked at Tokyo Bay. The war in the Pacific was finally over.'

Back in the Philippines, the long-standing quest for independence also resumed. The Malacañan Palace was turned over to the Commonwealth government with Sergio Osmeña as the president. The Congress was once again able to convene and called for a general election on April 23, 1946. This particular race was won by Manuel Roxas, the third and final head of the Commonwealth and first for the Third Philippine Republic. Independence was finally proclaimed on July 4, 1946.

However, this feat came at a very unlikely, if not unfavorable time. The country was profoundly destroyed, both in the physical and the emotional sense. Buildings, houses, and other public works had been reduced to rubble while thousands of lives were prematurely ended by the war and its atrocities. Families were broken and a collective trauma among the populace was rather apparent. The enthusiasm for self-rule was replaced by anxiety caused by an uncertain future for the country. With a nation extensively damaged, where would rebuilding begin? How would the deep wounds inflicted by the war heal? Should the alleged war crime perpetrators and collaborators be punished or forgiven?

Such questions were probably the ones Filipinos had to confront during the early years of the postwar period. In this chapter, with the use of primary sources, the following will be discussed: the declaration of independence, the process of rehabilitation of the Philippines, and some of its other then-pressing concerns such as the damaged economy, the issue of US military bases in the islands, and the controversial collaboration issue with the Japanese. Some of the sources included are the Treaty of Manila of 1946, photos of postwar Philippines, the Bell Trade Act, the Military Bases Agreement of 1947, and the text of the amnesty provided by President Roxas to Filipinos charged with treasonable collaboration with the Japanese.

> The signing of the Treaty of General Relations and Protocol or the Treaty of Manila of 1946 meant that the long-standing quest of the Filipinos to be free finally materialized. This historic event took place in Manila and was attended by several high-ranking Philippine and US officials. The raising of the Philippine flag and the lowering of the US flag were done in the ceremony.

### Treaty of General Relations and Protocol of 1946 or Treaty of Manila
The eventual Filipino independence promised by the Americans was formally realized in Manila on July 4, 1946, a date now regarded as the Republic Day or Filipino-American Friendship Day. This day marked the ratification of the document known as the Treaty of General Relations and Protocol or the Treaty of Manila of 1946. It was signed by Pres. Manuel Roxas and by the US High Commissioner, Paul V. McNutt the personal representative of US President Harry Truman to the Philippines.

This agreement officially 1) recognized the Philippines as an independent nation; 2) relinquished US sovereignty over the entire Philippine islands; and 3) gave the US to a) diplomatically represent the Philippines in other countries while a Foreign Service Office was pending to be established; and (b) to maintain its military bases in the archipelago. The full text of the treaty follows.

>[!NOTE]
> After the bombing of the Japanese August 1945, Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced to his people the formal surrender of the empire and their acceptance of the provisions written in the Potsdam Declaration. This was done through a radio broadcast now known as the Jewel Voice Broadcast aired on August 15, 1945, Hirohito read to his constituents the so-called Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War which contained Japan's formal surrender.

*TREATY OF GENERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA*
The Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America, being animated by the desire to cement the relations of close and long friendship existing between the two countries, and to provide for the cognition of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines as of July 4, 1946, and the relinquishment of American sovereignty over the Philippine Islands, have agreed upon the following articles:

The two countries further agree that any such arrangements are to be subject to termination when in the judgment of either country such arrangements are no longer necessary,

>[!NOTE]
> While Manila stained a great deal of destruction as one of the main sites of the Pacific theater of the Second World War another city in Europe similarly suffered the same fate - Poland. German forces occupied the city in September 1909 and fell under a German-controlled puppet government. The Jewish population of the city which made up around 30 percent of the entirety, was moved to a separate quarters before Hitler started the "Final Solution" or the extermination of the Jews it has been estimated that around 90 percent of Poland's Jewish population was murdered by the Nazis, most notably with the use of gas chambers.

Photos of Manila After the War
The narratives about the ten-year transition period of the Philippines, as promised by the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, were unfortunately blemished by the atrocities of the war in the Pacific. As a next logical target of the Japanese Empire's expansionism which worked along the lines of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Philippines was ultimately dragged into the said worldwide conflict when Japanese forces invaded the Philippines hours after the destruction of Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
The next few years were some of the darkest in the archipelago's history-thousands of lives were lost; the economy was in bad shape; there was widespread famine; and the land was extensively damaged. It has been purported that Manila, next to the Polish capital of Warsaw, sustained the greatest physical destruction among the major theaters of the Second World War. The damage caused by the war to Manila, especially toward the end of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, had been well-documented in different photographs. Some of these are found below.

### Excerpt from the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 or Bell Trade Act
Anticipating the eventual granting of independence to the Filipinos, a member of the US House of Representatives, Charles Jasper Bell of Missouri, filed a bill in September 1945 which aimed to govern the future trading relations between the US and the Philippines. This bill was later passed as a law and has since been known as the Philippine Trade Act or the Bell Trade Act of 1946. Some of the main provisions of the bill include
1) the fixed 2:1 exchange rug between the Philippine peso and the US dollar; 
2) the unlimited free trade between the Philippines and the US for the next eight years;
3) the gradual placing of tariffs on trade products until fall rates are achieved in 1974
4) and the granting of parity rights to the Americans. 
The fourth provision meant that American entities can tap resources which was reserved to the Filipinos as stated in the 1935 Philippine Constitution. Simply put, the Bell Trade Act compelled the Congress to amend the Constitution.
	The bill was received negatively by some critics for it was thought to tie the Philippines to the US economically even after the granting of independence. However, the US passed the bill as a complement to the Philippine Rehabilitation Act, which pledged a total of $620,000,000 ($120 million for the construction of public works, $400 million for individual damages, and $100 million in war surplus goods) as war reparations. However, the Rehabilitation Act provided that payments larger than $500 shall not be released unless the Philippines ratifies the Bell Trade Act first. This meant that the Philippines had to consent to both of the legislations in order to avail of the much needed war reparations. Through the Commonwealth Act 733 enacted on July 3, 1946, the Bell Trade Act was ratified by the Philippine Congress. An excerpts of the Act is found below.

### Excerpt from 1947 Military Bases Agreement
As explicitly stated in the Treaty of Manila of 1946, the US intended to continue to use the Philippines for its military operations in the Pacific. This was openly expressed by the US government despite granting independence to the Filipinos the previous year. While public disclosure on an agreement pertinent to US bases was only made in 1947, it must be noted that negotiations for the continental presence of Americans banned in the Philippines started in 1943, when the Commonwealth government was in exile in Washington. Many believed that the preservation of US bases in the country, as well as the granting of parity rights to the Americans, was inconsistent with the idea of independence. Nevertheless, arguing along the lines of peace, mutual defense, and military cooperation, the Philippines under Roxas, allowed the US to maintain military bases in the country by signing the Agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines Concerning Military Bases also known as the 1947 Military Bases Agreement. An excerpt of the agreement follows.

### Proclamation No.51 by Pres. Manuel Roxas
While struggling to heal its citizens, rebuild its public works and economy, and negotiate its relations with the US, the Philippines was also confronted with a highly sensitive matter -  the issue of collaboration with the Japanese. When the Commonwealth government was about to go on exile in December 1941, President Quezon left some  prominent members of his government so they could provide necessary protection for the Filipinos and deal with the advancing Japanese troops. These included Secretary of  Justice Jose Abad Santos who was briefly made the acting President of the Commonwealth, former senator and acting Chief Justice Jose P. Laurel, Secretary of Agriculture Benigno S. Aquino Sr., and the City Mayor of Manila Jorge Vargas.

After the Americans had successfully regained the Philippines and granted its independence, the Commonwealth government, through Act No. 682, set up a *People's Court*, tasked to investigate alleged war crimes. Leading Filipino figures during the  Japanese Occupation were then arrested and charged with treasonable collaboration. In  September 1946, Laurel appeared before the court to plead not guilty. To a courtroom full of seasoned lawyers and judges like himself, Laurel eloquently proclaimed, 
> "I am neither pro-Japanese nor pro-American, I am pro-Filipino... There is no law that condemn me for having placed the welfare of my people over and above that of America. I am not expecting a decoration. I do not claim to be a hero... Although human justice may err, what matters is that I am innocent before my conscience and my God... I shall  face my Creator in full confidence that I had dedicated my powers, talents, and energies to the service of my country at a time when she needed me most."

To solve the collaboration issue, and especially to prevent the government from losing some of its sharpest minds such as Laurel and Claro M. Recto, a blanket amnesty was proclaimed by Pres. Manuel Roxas in 1948. The text of this proclamation follows:

**Primary Source**
<center>Proclamation No.51</center>
<center>A PROCLAMATION GRANTING AMNESTY</center>

$\quad$WHEREAS, the occupation of the Philippines by the Japanese armed forces during the last war and the organization by them of a government administered by citizens of the Philippines but subject to their direction and control have given rise to charges of collaboration with the enemy against such citizens of the Philippines who occupied positions in that government, as well as against those who traded with the enemy;
$\quad$WHEREAS, as a result of those charges, indictments have been filed against a large number of Filipino citizens for alleged treasonable collaboration with the enemy before the People's Court, which was established especially to hear and try those cases;
$\quad$WHEREAS, these trials have been held for more than two years now, but no final judgments convicting any one of the accused have been rendered;
$\quad$WHEREAS, the Supreme Court has declared that the mere holding of a position in the government established by the enemy does not per se constitute the crime of treason under the laws of the Philippines;
$\quad$WHEREAS, with respect to those who are at present indicted for alleged trading with the enemy, it appears that because aside from the requirements of the two-witness rule in treason trials, it has been declared necessary to prove specifically that the materials involved in the trading were essential to the prosecution of the war, no final judgments of conviction have been entered so far in such cases and, on the contrary several verdicts of acquittal have been rendered and orders of dismissal issued;
$\quad$WHEREAS, the majority of the Filipino people now realize that the alleged acts attributed to political collaborators either were not voluntary on their part or, in effect, ware performed by them in the sincere belief that it was their patriotic duty to execute them in the interest of the safety and well-being of their countrymen who were then at the mercy of the enemy;
$\quad$WHEREAS, with the lapse of time there has come a better understanding on the part of the Filipino people of the motives which actuated the persons who held positions under the occupation government, and there is evidence that a majority of the people have fully vindicated the accused, convinced that in the discharge of their functions as public officials they did everything in their power to minimize the atrocities of the enemy and to prevent the carrying out of his purpose to induce or compel the Filipino people to arm themselves against the allied nations;
>[!INFO]
> Jose P. Laurel was born on 1891 in Tanauan, Batangas to Jacobs Garcia and Sotero Laurel, a signatory to the Malolos Constitution Laurel was educated at the University of the Philippines (UP), University of Santo Tomas (UST), and Yale University He served different positions in the government upon his return from the States, but was perhaps best-known for being the president of the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Republic, then later, as an associate justice to the Supreme Court and senator during the postwar period. He also held teaching positions at UP, UST, the Far Eastern University, and Adamson University.

>[!ABSTRACT]
> The People's Court was set up after Commonwealth Act no. 682 was enacted on September 1945. The people's court was composed of a presiding judge and 14 associate justices whose duty was to decide on all "cases of crimes against national security" done during the Japanese period.

$\quad$WHEREAS under the laws of the Philippines and the doctrines laid down by our counts the prosecution of the cases now pending appears unjustified with regard to alleged political collaborators and futile as to those charged with economic collaboration;
$\quad$WHEREAS, the question of collaboration has divided the people of the Philippines since liberation in a manner which threatens the unity of the nation at a time when the public welfare requires that said unity be safeguarded and preserved;
$\quad$WHEREAS, the question of collaboration is essentially political in nature and should be settled in accordance with the conscience of the majority of the people;
$\quad$WHEREAS, it appears that the overwhelming sentiment of the people of this Republic is now in favor of resolving this question as speedily as possible by the grant of amnesty to all persons who have been accused or may hereafter be accused of treason through alleged collaboration with the enemy;
$\quad$WHEREAS, this public sentiment does not extend to persons who voluntarily took up arms against the alleged nations or the members of the resistance forces, or acted as spies or informers of the enemy, or committed murder, arson, coercion, robbery physical injuries or any other crime defined and punished in our penal laws, for the purpose of aiding and abetting the enemy in the war against the allied nations, or in the suppression of the resistance movement in the Philippines;
$\quad$NOW, THEREFORE, I, Manuel Roxas, President of the Philippines by virtue of the power in me vested by Article VII, section 10(6) of the Constitution, so hereby proclaim and grant full and complete amnesty to all persons accused of any offense against the national security for acts allegedly committed to give aid and comfort to the enemy during the last war, provided, however, That this amnesty shall not extend to persons who are now or may hereafter be accused of treason for having taken up arms against the allied nations of the members of the resistance forces, for having voluntarily acted as spies or informers of the enemy, or for having committed murder, arson, coercion, robbery, physical injuries, or any other crime against person or property, for the purpose of aiding and abetting the enemy in the war against the allied nations or in the suppression of the resistance movement in the Philippines.
$\quad$All cases now pending before the courts for alleged offenses coming within the terms of the amnesty herein granted shall be dismissed by the respective courts on their own motion or upon petition by the prosecution or the accused.
$\quad$This proclamation shall take effect upon the concurrence therewith by the Congress.

$\quad$IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the Republic of the Philippines to be affixed.

$\quad$Done in the City of Manila, this 28th day of January, in the year of Our Lord, nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the Philippines, the second.

## Chapter Summary
- Philippine independence from the US was formally recognized after the Treaty of Manila had been signed on July 6, 1946. While this could be considered a feat for the Filipinos and an absolute watershed in the history of the country, independence came at an extremely troubled time. Fresh from the war, the Philippines was extremely destroyed. Thousands of lives had been lost; public works had been rendered inutile; and the country was plagued by the issue of collaboration.
- The country also had to confront issues pertinent to its relations with the US. With its heavy losses from the war, the US tried to continue utilizing the Philippines in various ways to the former's advantages. Economically, the Philippines was tied to US as seen in the provisions of the Bell Trade Act. Likewise, the armed forces of the US continued to have the military presence in Philippine soil through the 1947 Military Bases Agreement.
- The collaboration issue was resolved by the granting of amnesty by Pres. Manuel Roxas.
