> one of the most prominent Jesuit missionary and historian of the early colonial period.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Colin discusses the customs and tradition of the natives of the Philippines</mark> as well as the people from other parts of Southeast Asia such as Sumatra and Moluccas.

In his *Labor of Evangelica*, the most studied groups are **Tagalogs** and **Visayans** wherein Colin discussed at length their:
- physical appearance
- clothing
- marriage
- eating patterns
- songs & dances
- bathing habits

**Primary Sources**
- There were <mark class="hltr-blue">no kings/rulers</mark> worthy of mention, throughout this archipelago, but there were many chiefs who dominated others less powerful. ^Chiefs

>[!NOTE|alt-co] Manila had two chiefs with equal power: <u>Uncle</u> & <u>Nephew</u>

**Barangays** - preserving the name of from a boat in which they came to settle the islands

**Datus** - political leader in the barangay, captain/pilot, who was accompanied by his children, relatives, friends, and comrades. He also had shares in the tributes paid by the people, called **<u>buhis</u>**

**Timawas/Maharlikas(Visayan)** - commoners/freemen in the early Filipino

- Seizing the lands, they began to cultivate them and to make use of them. They seized as much of the sea and near-by rivers as they could preserve and defend from any other barangay, or from many barangays, according as <mark class="hltr-blue">they had settled near or far from others</mark>.
- Although on all occasions some barangays, aided and protected others, yet the <mark class="hltr-blue">slaves or even the timaua/freemen could not pass from one barangay to another</mark>, especially a married man/woman, <mark class="hltr-blue">without paying a certain quantity of gold</mark>, and <mark class="hltr-blue">giving a public feast to his whole barangay</mark>.

>[!INFO|alt-co] a married man/woman's children has to be divided between barangays, in the same manner as slaves

- The datu is the arbiter of the law, acted as the judge of the barangay.
- In criminal cases, there were <mark class="hltr-blue">wide distinctions made because of the rank of the murderer and</mark> the slain; and if <mark class="hltr-blue">the latter</mark> were a <mark class="hltr-blue">chief all his kinsmen went to hunt for the murderer and his relatives</mark>, and both <mark class="hltr-blue">sides engaged in war</mark>, until mediators undertook to <mark class="hltr-blue">declare the quantity of gold due for that murder</mark>, in accordance with the appraisals which the old men said ought to be paid according to their custom.
- The <mark class="hltr-lightred">penalty of death was never imposed by process of law</mark>
