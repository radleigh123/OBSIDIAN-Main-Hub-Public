**Primary Sources** - Marriage rituals & Ceremonies
- Only those who were [[HIST101PRELIMch2LabelEvangelica#^Chiefs|chiefs]] and wealthy were allowed to have some female [[concubines]]
- Only among the Visayans did the first religious ministers of the gospel find established the custom of <mark class="hltr-blue">one man having many legitimate wives</mark>, and <mark class="hltr-blue">that of large dowries</mark>, which was no small obstruction to the planting of the gospel. The <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">general rule for each man to have one legitimate wife</mark> and they tried to obtain one <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">who was of their own family</mark>, and <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">even very closely related to them</mark>, <mark class="hltr-lightred">barring out the first degree</mark>, for what was always a direct implement to their marriage. Their marriages were not indissoluble, as are those of Christians. For if the consort returned the dowry, one to the other, the one at fault to the one without blame, that was sufficient for repudiation; and they could marry others, unless the couple had children, in which case all the dowry was given to these. If profits had been made with the lapse of time, while they had lived together, those profits were divided between them both, if the gains were in common but if they were the secret gains one of them, then that one kept them.

**dowry** / **bigaycaya** - always given by the man, the parents of the girl determining the sum beforehand, at the time when they discussed the marriage.
**pasonor** - bestow some gift to the married couple to suit the occasion (slaves, gold jewels, land)
**panhimuyat** - sum that had to be paid to the mother of the bride in return for her care and labor in the rearing and education of her daughter
**pasoso** - sum that was to be paid to the *chichiva*/*nurse*, who had reared her.

**palapala** - a sort of bower, which they make the house larger so that all guests may be accommodated easily.
