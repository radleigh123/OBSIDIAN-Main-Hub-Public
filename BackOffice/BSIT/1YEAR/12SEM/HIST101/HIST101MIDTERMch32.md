## Beginnings of Colonial Control
**Encomienda System** - <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">stable government</mark>, the implementation of the aims of Spanish colonization needs to establish orderly procedure of tax collection and labor employment

>[!INFO]+ encomienda 
> **encomienderos**
>- was a royal grant to a deserving conquistador in recognition to their loyal services to the crown
>- not of property, but of <u>jurisdiction</u> over a definite territory and its *native inhabitants*
>- <u>the right to collect tributes or taxes from the inhabitants</u>

**Early 1571** King Phillip II, Legazpi divided Cebu into several encomiendas and assigned them to his men

The following duties are:
1. provide protection to the Filipino from attack;
2. maintain peace and order on his encomienda;
3. help the missionaries in propagating Christianity;
4. educate the people in his encomienda;
5. give proper and humane treatment to the natives

It became a source of corruption for the encomienderos, committed numerous acts of injustices such as:
1. collection of excessive tributes that allowed by the king;
2. confiscating animals, lands, crops, and farm tools without paying the natives
3. cruel treatment of the people
4. forced the natives to work for them without pay

> Encomienda system became the breeding grounds for abuses and corruption

**Domingo Salazar** - first Bishop of Manila, defender of the natives
- "Tribute may not be collected from those encomiendas where religious instruction has been and is being given"
- **alcadias** - a replacement, the King to take steps in dismantling the system

Three Classes of Encomienda:
- **Royal** - those set aside for the King
- **Ecclesiastical** - those assigned to the different religious orders
- **Private** - those given to the Spaniards who helped in the conquest and colonization of the Philippines
