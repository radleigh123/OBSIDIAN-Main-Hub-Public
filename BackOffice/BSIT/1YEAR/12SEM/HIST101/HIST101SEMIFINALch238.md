What is the difference between reformation and revolution?
<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Reform</mark> implies that changes are made to the existing structure
<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Revolution</mark> entails the disruption and the radical change that replaces the structure with a new one

In the case of a reform, change is brought about gradually, meaning that there is no drastic disruption of the existing political system â€“ thus allowing citizens to adapt to the changes in an easier way and allowing all social groups to move forward in a cohesive manner. Conversely, a revolution is a drastic and sudden change that often has backlashes on the social groups that have to deal with the legacy of violence
