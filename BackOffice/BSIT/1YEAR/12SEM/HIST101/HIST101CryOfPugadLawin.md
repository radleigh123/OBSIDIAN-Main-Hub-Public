**Cry of Pugad Lawin**

was the beginning of the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire.[1]

In late **August 1896**, members of the Katipunan led by Andrés Bonifacio revolted somewhere around Caloocan, which included parts of the present-day Quezon City.

Originally the term cry referred to the first clash between the Katipuneros and the Civil Guards (Guardia Civil). The cry could also refer to the tearing up of community tax certificates (cédulas personales) in defiance of their allegiance to Spain. The inscriptions of "*Viva la Independencia Filipina*" can also be referred as term for the cry. This was literally accompanied by patriotic shouts.
