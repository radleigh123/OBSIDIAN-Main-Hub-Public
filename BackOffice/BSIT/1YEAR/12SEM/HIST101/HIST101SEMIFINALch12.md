## Excerpt from “The Philippines in Distress”
**Graciano Lopez Jaena** was born on **December 29, 1856** in **Jaro, Iloilo**. He was educated at the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">seminary of Jaro</mark>. At a very young age, he wrote a satirical piece entitled “*<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Fray Botod</mark>*” which depicted the abuses of the friars. He eventually left for Spain to study medicine in **1880**. He did not finish his studies, however, and turned to journalism and politics instead. A friend to the Filipinos in Spain and closely associated with the Spanish liberals, he <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">gained fame</mark> as an orator delivering speeches to various audiences and writing numerous articles for progressive newspapers with Philippine problems as one of his preferred subjects. He proved to be an astute critic of Spanish colonial government and its policies. His command of the Spanish language impressed even the Spaniards. He became the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">first editor of _La Solidaridad_ in **1889**</mark> when it was established in Barcelona. He died on **January 20, 1896** in <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Barcelona, Spain</mark>.

The following text describes the Philippines under an economic crisis; it also discusses what Lopez Jaena deemed as the cause of this “distress” suffered by the country.

**Primary Source**
In the face of the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">frightful economic crisis</mark> in the country is suffering, the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">forbearance of the Administration</mark> of that country is <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">astounding</mark>. This is <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">the consequence of the lack of foresight</mark>, a characteristics of the colonial government whose blunders and anomalies always lead countries like the Philippines today to ruin.

The ineptitude of the government of the Philippines is the cause of this ruin that is dragging her to the abyss. In proof of this the budget receipts increases from year to year and for some years past with deficit in the budget of expenses without any noticeable improvement in the whole Archipelago. The General Office of Civil Administration neither administers nor promotes nor educates. It sleeps on its official documents and the Governor General who, as it is known by everybody, is always a general of the army, spend his time reviewing troops and organizing the country on a military basis rather than in governing and leading the country towards progress. Anyone who has visited the Archipelago cannot but agree with us that the Philippines, even in a normal state of peace and order, seem to be always in an exceptional condition, without constitutional guarantees. Any commotion alarms the Government, interpreting it as a conspiracy and immediately the military courts begin to function. The decline of a country thus governed cannot be expected, as it is now happening to our beautiful Archipelago.

Although at first glance, bureaucracy and intolerance are the reflected and remote causes of the decline of a country and consequently of the crisis in her commerce, industry and agriculture, by examining them carefully they are, more than any other, the direct and organic cause of the prostration of a people just as their opposite, freedom, is the origin of all the progress of a nation.

“*<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">The Causes of the Distress of the Philippines</mark>*” was <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">first published in Espana en Filipinas (**1887**)</mark>. In this article, Lopez Jaena mentions several other causes of the distress in the country, as a continuation of the article he wrote previously, “*<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">The Philippines in Distress</mark>*.”

After those mentioned in the preceding article, the most notable cause of the backwardness of the Philippines is the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">normalous education</mark> given to the <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">youth</mark> in schools. They <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">learned to read correctly</mark> and <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">to write gracefully</mark>, but <mark class="hltr-lightred">they do not learn useful things</mark> because they are not taught any. They <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">are taught how to pray but never to work</mark>.

In all public schools Spanish grammar is conspicuous by its absence, because certain people place obstacles to teaching the Indio Spanish, the elements of physics, chemistry, geography and agriculture knowledge which is certainly useful to the future or individual and the progress of the nation, but if all these subjects are conspicuous by their absence, on the other hand, never absent are the rosary, trisagion, the thousand and one novenas of the saints, the Virgin and the martyrs with which the tender minds of the children are nourished spiritually and viciously....

The continuous change of personnel in the government is another cause of the havoc and disasters in the Philippines and in the colonies in general. Such a swift change is only comparable to the locusts which, after devastating the fields, are replaced in swift and vertiginous succession. If too this is added in the competence of the majority of the government personnel, it becomes evident that from progression to progression, the country in a short time reaches the apogee of her ruin.

The <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">fatal omission</mark> of natives from the government positions of high or average importance is its corollary; the lack of any improvement in the Philippines, the towns remaining stagnant and backward. Since some of those who give orders, who govern and administer are inept and insecure in their posts, it matters little to them whether the country improves and advances or not.

We are not unaware that there exist royal decrees on the filling of the government positions with natives, but the truth is these are not followed and the law and everything else about this matter are a dead letter...

The abolition of the existing differential duties, freedom of commerce, freedom of association, freedom of the press through which the Filipino may study or learn about the progress of all the branches of industry, commerce and agriculture for their own benefit and for that of their country, as well as how to convert China and Japan into markets for our products through the negotiation of commercial treaties with them, are the supreme remedies to reactivate and restore to life the already comatose Philippines commerce...

It is urgent to establish free ports for the benefit of the natives of the country, in as much as nature has created. These ports for the use of the people who live in them. To go against nature is to violate natural law; it is to infringe on the every work of God. Human justice, policy and government should act in conformity with, never against the laws of nature.
