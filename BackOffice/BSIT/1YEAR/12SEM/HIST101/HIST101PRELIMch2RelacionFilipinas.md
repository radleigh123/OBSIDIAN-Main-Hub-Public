- no one is made a slave or is put to death for any crime which he commits (theft, adultery, or murder) - <mark class="hltr-blue">except that for each crime there is an established fine</mark>, which they have to pay in jewels/gold, and if the culprit is unable to pay the fine <mark class="hltr-blue">he will borrow the money, and pledge himself to the man from whom he borrows</mark>, thus becoming a slave.

>[!NOTE|alt-co] shall he repay, he will be free again
