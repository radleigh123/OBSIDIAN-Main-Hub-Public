## Results of the Journey
The Victoria brought in a cargo of species equivalent to about 25 tons, the sale of which amounted to something like 1,500 gold ducats. The amount exceeded the total cost of the entire expedition. But far beyond its material value, the Magellan expedition netted the following results:
- it marked the first circumnavigation of the world, thereby, proving the beyond question the sphericity of the earth
- it expanded the frontiers of geographical knowledge making to known to Europe the existence of the Pacific Ocean, Oceania, and the Philippines
- it paved the way for the Spanish Colonization and Christianization of the Philippines
