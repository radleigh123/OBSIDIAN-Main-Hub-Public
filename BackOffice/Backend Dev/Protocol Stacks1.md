As hinted to earlier in the section about [[Protocol Stacks|protocol stacks]], one may guess that there are many protocols that are used on the Internet. This is true; <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">there are many communication protocols required for the Internet to function</mark>. These include the [[TCP]] and [[IP]] protocols, [[routing protocols]], [[medium access control protocols]], [[application level protocols]], etc. 

The following sections describe some of the more important and commonly used protocols on the Internet. Higher level protocols are discussed first, followed by lower level protocols:
- [[HTTP & WWW|Application Protocols: HTTP and the World Wide Web]]
- [[SMTP|Application Protocols: SMTP and Electronic Mail]]
- [[TCP|Transmission Control Protocol]]
- [[IP|Internet Protocol]]
