## How PoP connects to [[NAP]]
Think of the Point of Presence (PoP) as a big box of toys that an internet service provider (ISP) keeps in their room. The ISP uses the toys in the box to provide internet services to their customers. But sometimes, the ISP needs to get more toys or share some of their toys with other ISPs. This is where Network Access Points (NAPs) come in.

NAPs are like big playgrounds where different ISPs can come together to share their toys (or more accurately, exchange internet traffic). The ISPs can connect their networks to each other at a NAP so they can share internet traffic between their customers.

To get to the NAP, the ISP takes some of the toys from their box (the PoP) and brings them to the playground (the NAP). At the NAP, the ISP can connect their toys to the toys of other ISPs and share internet traffic between their customers. This helps the ISP provide better internet services to their customers and also helps the other ISPs provide better services to their customers.

So, the Point of Presence and Network Access Points work together to help ISPs provide better internet services to their customers by allowing them to connect their networks to each other and share internet traffic.

## Adding [[NSP#^5bf3ab|Peering Points]]
Peering points are like little playgrounds where just a few ISPs can come together to share their toys (or exchange internet traffic) directly with each other. Instead of going to the big playground (NAP) to exchange traffic, the ISPs meet at a smaller playground (peering point) to exchange traffic directly.

When an ISP wants to exchange traffic with another ISP, they take some of the toys from their box (the PoP) and bring them to the peering point. There, they can connect their toys directly to the toys of the other ISP and exchange traffic between their customers.

Peering points are useful for ISPs that exchange a lot of traffic with each other because it can be faster and cheaper to exchange traffic directly instead of going through a NAP. However, not all ISPs have peering relationships with each other, so they may still need to use a NAP to exchange traffic with other networks.
