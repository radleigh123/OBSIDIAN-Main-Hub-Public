### Summary
Now you know how the Internet works. But how long will it stay this way? The version of IP currently used on the Internet (version 4) only allows 232 addresses. Eventually there won't be any free IP addresses left. Surprised? Don't worry. IP version 6 is being tested right now on a research backbone by a consortium of research institutions and corporations. And after that? Who knows. The Internet has come a long way since it's inception as a Defense Department research project. No one really knows what the Internet will become.
