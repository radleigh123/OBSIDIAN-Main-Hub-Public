## Point of Presence (POP)
is the Network Interface Point between communicating entities. It is located in a data-center that houses servers, routers, network, switches, multiplexers and other network interface equipment. A **PoP** is the local access point for an [[ISP|Internet Service Provider]] (ISP).

**PoP example:** Chris is watching Sky News on his laptop, Chris' ISP  is Verizon Fios. So Chris is part of Verizon Internet’s large network. When Chris types *<u>www\.skynews.com</u>* his <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">request first goes to  Verizon's **PoP**</mark>. But the sky news site is on another network, it is on *<u>skynews.com</u>* web servers. 
<center>So we have 2 different networks. Each one has a point of presence. But how does Chris's request get on to the Sky’s Network? </center>

We need a [[NAP|Network Access Point]] (NAP), it is a building where **[[ISP|ISPs]]** can switch information on to each other’s network. Now Chris’s request can get all the way over to skynews.com by using the NAP. And  skynews.com can get all the way back to Chris's computer.

>[!CITE] <center>is a <u>fundamental block of the telecommunication domain</u>. <br> <br> You must be aware of this concept. If you want to system design for video content delivery like YouTube, Netflix or Hotstar.com</center>
