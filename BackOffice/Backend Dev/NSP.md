## Network Service Providers (NSPs)
are companies that provide communication services to customers, typically over wired/wireless networks. They are responsible <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide these services</mark>, which may include cables, switches, routers, and other networking equipment.

> The primary customers of NSPs are other service providers, including **[[ISP|Internet Service Providers]]** (**ISPs**), which, in turn, sell internet access to businesses and consumers.

NSPs build and maintain the fiber optic cable and [[Core Routers]] -- i.e., the principal data routes -- that make up the internet. Their physical connections come together at internet exchange points, which is where regional ISPs can connect to an NSP backbone. These locations are also called **Peering points**. ^5bf3ab
