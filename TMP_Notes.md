**BASH VS GIT**
`Bash` (**B**ourne-**A**gain-**SH**ell) - is a <mark class="hltr-lightgreen">Unix shell and command-line interpreter</mark> that provides an environment for executing commands and scripts.
`Git` - is a v<mark class="hltr-lightgreen">ersion control system</mark> that allows developers to keep track of changes to their code and collaborate with other developers on a project. It can be used from within a *bash shell* or from any other environment that supports *Git*.

**DEMANDED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES**
As a backend developer, the most in-demand programming languages are typically Python, Java, and JavaScript (Node.js). Here's a brief overview of each language:
1.  Python: Python is a popular, high-level programming language that is widely used for server-side web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. It has a large, active community and a wealth of available libraries and frameworks that make it easy to get started.
2.  Java: Java is a mature, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for server-side web development, enterprise applications, and Android mobile app development. Java has a large, well-established ecosystem and is known for its stability, security, and performance.
3.  JavaScript (Node.js): JavaScript is a popular, dynamically-typed language that was originally designed for client-side web development. However, with the introduction of Node.js, it has become a popular choice for server-side development as well. JavaScript is known for its versatility and fast performance, and it's often used for real-time, scalable, and high-traffic applications.
PHP is also widely used for server-side web development, especially for building dynamic websites and content management systems (CMSs). However, it's less commonly used than the other three languages and may be less in demand in the job market.

In conclusion, the best language for you to invest in as a backend developer will depend on your personal preferences and the types of projects you want to work on. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with multiple languages and frameworks to increase your chances of landing a job and staying marketable in the future.

**C++ Language Learning Techniques**
Here are some tips to help you get the most out of the C++ language:
1.  Understand the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how it applies to C++. OOP is a programming paradigm that is heavily used in C++, and understanding the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism is essential to writing good C++ code.
2.  Make use of the standard template library (STL) that comes with C++. The STL contains a wide range of useful data structures and algorithms that can save you a lot of time and effort when writing code.
3.  Learn how to use smart pointers. Smart pointers are a C++11 feature that can help you manage memory more effectively and prevent common issues such as memory leaks and segmentation faults.
4.  Understand the difference between pass by value and pass by reference. Knowing when to use each one can greatly improve the performance of your code.
5.  Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) technique where possible. The RAII technique ensures that resources are acquired and initialized at the time an object is constructed and are properly released when the object is destroyed.
6.  Understand the difference between **lvalue** and **rvalue** references. This can help you write more efficient code, particularly when working with move semantics and perfect forwarding.
7.  Familiarize yourself with the C++11 and C++14 features. C++11 and C++14 introduced many new features that can make your code more expressive and efficient.
8.  Be aware of the different types of initialization and how they work. The way you initialize your variables can have a big impact on the performance and correctness of your code.
9.  Always use the `const` keyword where possible. Using `const` can help prevent bugs and improve performance by making it clear when a value should not be modified.
10.  Write clear, readable, and well-organized code. This will make it easier to maintain and improve your code in the future.
    

Note that these are just a few tips to improve your C++ programming, and there are many more ways to improve your skills and write better code. It's always a good idea to continually learn and explore new features and libraries that the language offers.

## Dynamic Array of strings
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int size = 5;
    char **strArr = (char **)malloc(size * sizeof(char *));

    if (strArr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Allocate memory for each string
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	    // Assume maximum string length of 50 characters
        strArr[i] = (char *)malloc(50 * sizeof(char));
    }

    // Initialize the strings
    strcpy(strArr[0], "Hello");
    strcpy(strArr[1], "World");
    strcpy(strArr[2], "OpenAI");
    strcpy(strArr[3], "ChatGPT");
    strcpy(strArr[4], "Example");

    // Print the strings
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", strArr[i]);
    }

    // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        free(strArr[i]);
    }
    free(strArr);

    return 0;
}
```
